# Game Studio

Kids vibe-code 2D JavaScript games with **Phaser 3** that run **locally in the
browser**, fully sandboxed. Part of the kid Learn surface (`/learn/*`).

This is the game-flavored sibling of the [code studio](../code/). It reuses that
studio's iframe security model and (eventually) its server-side AI coding loop,
but the preview hosts Phaser + a game canvas instead of a generic web page.

## How it works (1-minute version)

The Playground is a **3-phase flow** (`PlaygroundApp.tsx`):

1. **Landing** — a Gemini-style prompt box (with an animated rotating
   brand-gradient glow border) and a row of starter game chips. Describe a game
   and hit Enter / the send button.
2. **Generating** — a blocking "building your game" animation (a spinning
   gradient orb + a staged status list + progress bar) while the (stubbed)
   scaffold generator runs, then it advances to the workspace.
3. **Workspace** — the studio, in one of **two layout modes** picked by the
   top-right toggle (**default: Windows**):
   - **Windows** — three draggable, stackable floating windows: **💬 Chat**,
     **</> Code Editor**, **🎮 Game Runner** (no taskbar / desktop icons).
   - **Split** — a resizable split: a left region with a **💬 Chat / </> Code**
     tab strip and the **Game Runner** on the right.

Inside the workspace:

1. The generated game is a small **multi-file** Phaser project (`main.js` +
   `src/scenes/*.js` + a stylesheet); the studio owns the surrounding HTML.
2. **Chat** is its own pane now (a window, or the Chat tab). The **Code Editor**
   has a nested file tree (Files / Assets tabs) and a multi-tab Monaco editor.
   Editing + ▶ Play (or an AI turn) update the in-memory files and re-run.
3. `buildGamePreview.ts` assembles a single self-contained HTML document
   (`srcdoc`): a `#game` mount point, the vendored Phaser `<script>`, a console
   shim, a control shim, then **every `.js` file** (entry `main.js` last).
4. The **Game Runner** renders that document via `GameFrame.tsx` in a
   locked-down `<iframe>` (`sandbox="allow-scripts …"`, **no**
   `allow-same-origin`) — the game runs JS and nothing else, can't reach the app,
   cookies, or the auth token. It shows a "Press ▶ to play" placeholder until you
   start it, then adds pause/mute, screen-size presets, a restart, a
   physics-debug toggle (draw hitboxes), a console toggle, and a status bar
   (Running/Paused · fps · logs).
5. `console.log`/errors inside the game are forwarded out via `postMessage` and
   shown in the console panel. Each error knows its **file and line** (every
   script carries a `//# sourceURL`), so the console offers a `file:line` button
   that **jumps to it in the editor**, plus an **Ask AI to fix** button that
   sends the error to the chat. The editor also has Phaser **autocomplete /
   hover docs / go-to-definition** (the vendored `phaser.d.ts` loaded into
   Monaco).

### The runtime contract for game code

- `Phaser` is available as a **global** — don't `import`/`export` (no module
  system in the sandbox; scenes are global classes, the entry `main.js` runs
  last and builds `new Phaser.Game(...)`).
- Mount your game into the element with `id="game"`.
- To use an image/sound, add it as a project asset and reference it by its path
  string (`this.load.image('hero', 'assets/hero.png')`); the build inlines it.

Phaser itself is vendored (self-hosted, not a CDN) at a content-hashed
`public/vendor/phaser-4.1.0-<hash>.min.js` (the app reads the URL from
`virtual:engine-vendors`). Monaco is an npm dep but lazy-loaded with
self-hosted workers (also no CDN). Windows mode uses `react-rnd@^10`; Split mode
+ the editor split use `react-resizable-panels@^2`.

## Run it in dev

The studio sits behind kid auth (`<ProtectedRoute kind="kid">`), so the only
entry is the authed `/learn/playground/:projectId` route (with
`/learn/playground/new` driving the create/landing flow). To see the sandboxed
runtime locally, sign in as a kid and open a game, or — for automated runs — use
the route-mocked authed harness (`e2e/helpers.ts`) the e2e specs rely on (it
stubs auth + the backend, so no real login/backend is needed).

```bash
# from airbotix-app/
npm run dev
```

> Port is **4321** (set in `vite.config.ts`), not Vite's default 5173.

You'll land on the **Landing** screen: type a prompt (or tap a starter chip) and
hit Enter → the **Generating** animation runs → the **Workspace** opens. It opens
in **Windows** mode (three floating windows — Chat, Code Editor, Game Runner);
use the top-right toggle to switch to **Split**. The generated project is a
multi-file Pong scaffold (move the green paddle with the **mouse** or **↑/↓**).
Edit a file and hit ▶ Play, press ▶ in the runner to start it, use
pause/mute/screen-size/restart/console, and send the AI a prompt (both the reply
and the scaffold are clearly-labelled **stubs**). The project files are in-memory
only — no save.

### Run the e2e tests

```bash
# from airbotix-app/
npm run test:e2e
```

This runs the Playwright specs in `e2e/playground.spec.ts` (config:
`playwright.config.ts`) against the authed `/learn/playground/:projectId` route
via a route-mocked authed harness (`e2e/helpers.ts`) — it boots the dev server
itself. Seventeen specs: landing → generating → workspace, the
multi-file scaffold, the Code Editor launch width (editor area doubled, file
column fixed), Monaco overflow widgets escaping the window (hover not clipped),
the layout toggle (Windows ⇄ Split), the stub AI chat turn,
the runner placeholder → Play, screen-size presets reshape the stage, a problem
(error or warning) auto-opens the console, jump-to-error (a located error opens
that file at that line), Ask AI to fix (error → chat agent), the editor
lazy-loading the Phaser `.d.ts`, chat-history persistence across the layout
toggle, the theme toggle (default light, carries into the workspace), the code
editor (status bar + Files/Assets split + file-column toggle), window dbl-click
maximize + restore-to-prior-position, and closed-window reopen.

### Entry route

The only entry is the authed `/learn/playground/:projectId` route in
`src/app/router.tsx` (behind `<ProtectedRoute kind="kid">`), with
`/learn/playground/new` driving the create/landing flow. Dev/e2e runs reach it
through a route-mocked authed harness (`e2e/helpers.ts`) — there is no separate
no-auth route. (The earlier DEV-only `/playground-sandbox` route has been
removed.)

## Not built yet

- **Real backend AI** — both the chat turn and the scaffold generation
  (`generateScaffold`) are local stubs today. The real loop runs **server-side**
  (`platform-backend/code-sessions`) via a future `playgroundApi.ts` over the
  `runTurn` seam; the kid surface never calls an LLM directly (all AI goes
  through `platform-backend /llm/*`).
- **Project save/load** — the VFS is in-memory only.
- The **authed product route** — `/learn/playground/:projectId` behind
  `<ProtectedRoute kind="kid">` + backend (plus a hub and a fullscreen
  `.../play` route). `PlaygroundApp` is dev-only for now.
- Backend `game` project kind + Phaser-aware agent prompt.
- `docs/product/prd/learn-game-studio-prd.md`.
