# Changelog

## 2026-07-23 (fix: restore Parent Portal mobile navigation)

### Fixed
- **Parent Portal navigation is reachable again on phones.** The existing bottom tabs and
  overflow sheet are now mounted by the Portal layout, share the live approvals count with
  the desktop drawer, reserve safe-area space above the fixed tabs, and use compact mobile
  page padding without changing the desktop layout.
- **Parent-to-kid handoff is reachable again from the Growth page.** A parent can open the
  selected child's Learn session without re-entering a family code or PIN, while the separate
  adult session remains available when they return to Portal. The profile edit action is also
  restored beside the Growth heading.

## 2026-07-22 (fix: Music Stage brand logo shows at every width)

### Fixed
- **The Airbotix logo no longer vanishes on windows narrower than 900px** (owner report:
  "左下角的 logo 没有显示"). The transport-bar brand block was wholesale-hidden below
  900px; now the logo always renders and only the divider + "Music Stage" surface name
  collapse on tight bars. The now-playing meta line also truncates on one line instead of
  wrapping into a vertical sliver next to the play button (BPM · key hidden <900px).

## 2026-07-22 (feat: let parents see and safely try the creative studios)

### Added
- **Real product previews on all four Parent Dashboard studio cards** — Story Blocks,
  Creative Code Studio, Art Studio and Music Stage now show compressed captures of the actual
  child workspace plus a plain-language explanation of what the parent is seeing.
- **Safe parent try-outs where the product already supports them** — Story Blocks and Creative
  Code Studio open their real public, no-sign-in demos in a new tab with an explicit “no Stars,
  nothing saved” boundary. Art Studio and Music Stage honestly remain preview-only until they
  have real public demo adapters; their cards explain that creating requires the child’s Learn
  sign-in instead of linking a parent into protected kid routes or presenting a fake demo.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: Music Stage — on-stage instrument pop + the swap replaces the character)

### Added
- **点乐器角色 → 舞台顶层弹出选择 pop（owner:"点击时右侧顶层有个 pop 直接选，这样有替换的感觉"）。**
  Tapping a band member now opens a picker right above them on the stage (anchored to the
  character, clamped inside the stage, 160ms pop-in, ✕ to close; opens only on an explicit
  tap — never via the post-generation auto-select). The left-deck style row and lane
  dropdown remain as alternate entries.
- **The picked instrument visibly replaces the character.** Choosing a D-MS20 real
  instrument swaps the stage glyph — pick the violin and a 🎻 stands where the guitarist
  was (`InstrumentStyle.stageGlyph`; the original timbre styles keep the slot's character —
  Electric Crunch is still a guitar). music-stage-prd v0.20.1.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: Music Stage — real-instrument palettes + in-lane sound picker)

### Added
- **每个乐队位扩成真实乐器面板（D-MS20，owner:"既然引擎支持，是否可以更换乐器"）。**
  The SpessaSynth engine already carries the full GM bank, so each slot's style list
  grows from 3 timbres to a kid-curated instrument palette: guitar slot adds 🎻 Violin /
  🎷 Saxophone / 🎺 Trumpet; bass adds 🎼 Cello / 📯 Tuba; piano adds 🪄 Harp / 🪘 Marimba /
  🪈 Flute; keys adds 🎻 Strings / 🪗 Accordion (10 new GM programs, all published to the
  smplr fallback tier too). Swaps stay 0⭐ + 1-beat audition.
- **In-lane sound picker.** The style name in each track-lane header is now a dropdown —
  swap sounds right where kids look, without hunting for the stage band member + left-deck
  row (owner twice could not find the old entry). Bottom lanes flip the menu upward so the
  scroll container can't clip it. The stage-tap → deck-row path still works.

### Fixed
- **Vocal lanes tell the truth**: Lead/Backing Vocals lanes showed the borrowed slot style
  ("Grand" / "Gritty Organ") while actually singing the D-MS18 choir programs — they now
  display 🎤 Choir / 🎙️ Oohs as fixed labels with no picker.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: Art Studio canvas is TRANSPARENT — Photoshop-style, D-ISF-7)

### Changed
- **The canvas ground is now TRANSPARENT, like Photoshop** (owner: 不是去白底,本身就是
  透明 — D-ISF-7, art-studio-canvas-and-intent-fix-prd v0.4; supersedes the v0.1 white-paper
  ground). The bitmap holds ONLY what the kid made; a design-token checkerboard
  (`hairline`/`canvas.pure` via `theme()`) renders in CSS underneath, so the eraser reveals
  transparency and white ink stays visible. **Every saved export keeps its alpha**: My
  Pictures snapshots, ✨ magic refs and the 🎮 game hand-off are native transparent PNGs —
  no matting needed for hand-drawn art (the D-ISF-6 ✂️ toggle stays for OPAQUE AI takes,
  whose model, gpt-image-2, still cannot output transparency — image-studio-prd v0.5).
  👀 coach vision snapshots composite on white (`exportPng(scale, 'white')`) because
  downstream rasterizers composite alpha unpredictably — display and storage stay
  transparent.

## 2026-07-22 (fix: SpessaSynth worklet vs Tone's standardized-audio-context)

### Fixed
- **The SpessaSynth engine never actually started** — caught by a real-browser local test
  (Playwright + level meter), not by unit tests: `Tone.getContext().rawContext` is a
  standardized-audio-context WRAPPER, so native `new AudioWorkletNode(rawContext)` threw
  `parameter 1 is not of type 'BaseAudioContext'` and every track silently degraded to the
  smplr tier (AC-11 working exactly as designed, hiding the failure). The engine now goes
  through Tone's own worklet API (`addAudioWorkletModule` + `createAudioWorkletNode`) —
  the wrapper-aware path `audioNodeCreators` exists for. Local proof after the fix: all
  three probe tracks (guitar/crunch, drums/rockkit, vocals/choir) report `engine: spessa`
  with real output level (peaks 0.10–0.17) and zero console warnings.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: Art Studio → game hand-off loses the white paper)

### Added
- **✂️ Default-on background removal when sending art into a game** (owner: art 应该是
  透明背景 — D-ISF-6, art-studio-canvas-and-intent-fix-prd v0.3). Art Studio pictures are
  opaque BY DESIGN (white canvas ground; gpt-image-2 rejects transparency — image-studio-prd
  v0.5), so "🎮 use in my game" shipped sprites with a white box around them. The game sheet
  now has a "✂️ Remove the white background" toggle (default ON): on send, near-white pixels
  CONNECTED TO THE EDGES are erased (`matting.ts` — pure BFS core, unit-tested), so a white
  eye highlight inside a character survives while the paper goes transparent; unchecking
  keeps the full scene for backgrounds. Client-side, 0★, PNG out. Pictures everywhere else
  (takes, My Pictures, portal) stay opaque.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: explain the four creative spaces from a parent's perspective)

### Changed
- Reframed the Parent Dashboard creative-spaces panel around the decisions a family actually
  needs to make: who each space suits, the concrete thing a child can create, the three-step
  learning loop, skills practised, where AI and Stars enter, and a useful follow-up question.
- Made every studio card independently expandable while keeping the parent surface read-only;
  the guide still sends families through My Family for child sign-in rather than crossing the
  parent/kid authentication boundary.

## 2026-07-22 (feat: Music Stage — SpessaSynth SF2 engine (Tier-0) + GeneralUser GS)

### Added
- **SpessaSynth becomes the primary Music Stage timbre engine** (owner: "重新换"→ 换引擎;
  music-stage-prd v0.19, D-MS19). A single `WorkletSynthesizer` (Apache-2.0) performs real
  SoundFont synthesis — envelopes, loop points, filters, modulators — from the professional
  **GeneralUser GS** soundfont (32MB, freely redistributable, self-hosted at
  `/soundfonts/sf2/GeneralUser-GS.sf2`). The worklet's 16 per-MIDI-channel dry outputs are
  routed one-per-track into the existing Tone.Channel strips, so mute / solo / volume / pan
  keep working unchanged; the wet effects bus stays unrouted so a muted lane can never leak
  reverb tails. Events schedule at exact AudioContext times (no timing regression vs smplr).
  Engine tier order is now **spessa → smplr (MusyngKite) → Tone.js fallback**, each failure
  degrading one tier (AC-11); the engine + soundfont boot behind the composing animation.
  Vocal tracks keep their D-MS18 choir programs; drum tracks use real GM kits
  (Standard/Room/Electronic) via `setDrums` + kit program.
- `soundfonts.yml` publishes the sf2 (LFS-aware fetch + RIFF sanity check) and verifies it
  through the SPA-fallback-rejecting check.

## 2026-07-21 (feat: make all four creative studios discoverable to parents and kids)

### Added
- **Parent Dashboard creative-spaces guide.** Parents now see Story Blocks, Creative Code
  Studio, Art Studio, and Music Stage together on `/portal`, with a plain-language explanation
  of each product, the exact Learn-home path their child follows, and a link to My Family for
  sign-in details.
- **Four direct studio cards on the kid Home.** `/learn` now puts all four live studios in one
  first-class grid with their real destinations; Art Studio and Music Stage are no longer hidden
  behind the generic “Explore all studios” card.

### Changed
- Extended the shared create-tool registry with stable discovery IDs, parent descriptions, and
  Learn paths so the parent and kid surfaces render from the same live/paused product truth.
- Released the Story Blocks autosave mutex before showing “saved”, so a child who immediately
  presses Go can persist mission completion instead of getting stuck on “Saving your personal
  path…”.

## 2026-07-22 (test: Art Studio save/reopen coverage gaps closed)

### Added
- **First spec for `ProjectDetailPage`** — the "🎨 Keep drawing" reopen entry (the flow behind
  the owner-reported "keep drawing 无法加载原始的图片" bug) finally has tests: an image
  artifact's ⋯ menu offers Keep drawing and navigates to `/learn/create/image` with exactly
  `{ editArtifactId, editProjectId }` (the state ArtStudioPage's reopen path consumes); a
  non-image artifact does not offer it.
- **First spec for `artifactBytes`** (D-IS-24 same-origin bytes proxy — the pixel loader behind
  canvas bases, reopened pictures and "use in my game"): auth header on the `/bytes` request,
  status-carrying error on failure, object-URL hook contract, no fetch without an artifact.
- **`exportPng`/`exportMask` contracts** (`strokeEngine.export.test.ts`): white ground; base
  included/excluded via the Mission `strokes-only` flag (D-IS-22); scale parameter; the mask is
  opaque black with the painted region ERASED (destination-out — the gpt-image edits contract)
  and stamps/fills cannot punch it.
- **Art Studio save edges + takes strip** (`ArtStudioPage.test.tsx`): ＋ new picture does NOT
  re-upload ops already snapshotted (savedOps dedup, exercised via upload-ok/generation-fail);
  an upload failure keeps the drawing on the canvas with the friendly error (nothing reset);
  tapping a film-strip take activates it and clears working strokes; hold-to-compare shows the
  sketch pixels only while pressed (D-IS-19).
## 2026-07-21 (feat: parents can request a private tutor from the Tutoring page)

### Added
- `/portal/tutoring` now starts with a **Book a teacher** panel. A parent selects one of
  their active children, describes the learning goal, chooses a preferred time, and sends
  an authenticated booking request. The page makes the non-instant contract explicit: the
  team confirms teacher, format, price and exact time before a lesson is booked, and no
  payment is taken at request time.
- The same panel lists the family's recent teacher requests with parent-facing states
  (request received, matching teacher, confirmed, closed), so the request does not disappear
  after submission. Families without an active child are directed to child setup.

## 2026-07-21 (feat: Music Stage — professional timbres: MusyngKite kit + sung vocal tracks)

### Changed
- **Music Stage timbres upgrade to the MusyngKite soundfont kit** (owner report: 音色明显
  不对/太电子). `SOUNDFONT_KIT` switches from FluidR3_GM to gleitz's higher-fidelity
  MusyngKite kit — same layout and per-program file names, audibly closer to real
  instruments. `soundfonts.yml` now publishes the MusyngKite tree (FluidR3_GM objects stay
  on the origin for previously-cached bundles).
- **Vocal tracks now sing instead of playing piano/synth.** `lead_vocals`/`backing_vocals`
  score tracks previously borrowed the piano/keys slot style — on the Pop preset the lead
  melody rendered as a sawtooth synth lead. They now load dedicated sampled vocal programs
  (GM 53 Choir Aahs / 54 Voice Oohs) via `VOCAL_GM_PROGRAMS` in `voices.ts`, overriding the
  slot style (style = None still silences them); the compose-time preload warms both.

### CI
- **`soundfonts.yml` verify step now rejects the SPA fallback.** HTTP 200 alone let the
  2026-07 sample-library outage go unnoticed for 9 days (CloudFront serves index.html as
  200 for missing objects); every published-origin check now fails on a `text/html`
  content-type.

## 2026-07-21 (fix: Art Studio — strokes stop vanishing + the kid's intent reaches the magic)

### Fixed
- **The just-finished stroke no longer vanishes after pen-up** (owner report: 一般第一笔,
  画一下就消失了). An animation frame scheduled by the last `pointermove` captured the
  previous render's `draw` closure; firing after `endStroke` committed the ops, it repainted
  the OLD (usually empty) op list — visually wiping the stroke the kid just drew. rAF
  repaints now run the latest `draw` via a ref, and pending frames are cancelled on unmount
  (`ArtCanvas`, D-ISF-1, art-studio-canvas-and-intent-fix-prd).
- **A tap now leaves a dot.** Single-point strokes (pointerdown + pointerup with no move)
  were silently discarded; they now commit and render as a dab (D-ISF-2).
- **🪣 fill works on Retina.** The flood fill read/wrote a 1024² LOGICAL-pixel window of a
  dpr-scaled backing bitmap (`getImageData`/`putImageData` ignore the canvas transform), so
  on dpr 2 it read only the top-left quadrant and painted it back misaligned. It now reads
  the full device-pixel bitmap and scales the tap point (`strokeEngine.renderOps`).
- **The coach's plan finally feeds ✨ Bring-to-life** (owner report: 画了马想换成牛,AI 不知道
  要干嘛). `/llm/image-plan` distils the conversation into `plan.prompt`, but the studio
  never read it — magic sent only the optional typed wish or the bare "my drawing". Prompt
  precedence is now typed wish → coach plan → fallback; the plan's style pre-selects and the
  magic sheet shows the plan sentence it is about to use (D-ISF-3).
- **🪄 magic brush now works on a raw hand-drawing.** It was gated on an existing AI take
  (`baseArtifactId`), so region-replace on a plain sketch had no entry point. With ink on
  the canvas the toggle appears; applying a mask first snapshots the canvas as the reference
  (same free upload ✨ uses), then edits with `ref_artifact_id` + `mask_b64` (D-ISF-4).
- **Masked edits describe the intent, not a bare noun.** The wish now rides inside a
  region-replace template ("Same picture, keep everything outside the highlighted region
  unchanged; the highlighted region becomes: …") per the gpt-image edits contract (D-ISF-5).
## 2026-07-21 (feat: parent password login — explicit method choice on sign-in, D-AUTH-21)

### Added
- **Parent email+password login (`auth-system-prd §4.8`, D-AUTH-21).** `/portal/login` now gives
  the parent an **explicit choice of sign-in method** — two first-class tabs, **Password** and
  **Email code**. Password is the default-selected tab; Email code is one tap away and stays the
  recovery path (a first-timer or forgotten password just uses a code — there is no separate reset
  flow). New `loginWithPassword()` hits `POST /auth/login-password`.
- **Set/change password in Settings.** `/portal/settings` "You" panel gains a Password control
  (`setPassword()` → `POST /auth/set-password`); copy toggles Set ↔ Change from the new
  `has_password` flag on `/auth/me`. Min 8 chars; a forgotten password just falls back to a code.

### Changed
- `UserPrincipal` / `MeResponse.user` carry `has_password`; `normaliseMe` defaults it to `false`.
- Parent login page reworked into a Password/Email-code tab chooser; tests updated to match.
## 2026-07-21 (feat: Portal Dashboard "Now enrolling" — a just-logged-in parent sees open classes)

### Added
- **"Now enrolling" panel on the Portal Dashboard (`/portal`).** A freshly-logged-in parent
  landed on the Dashboard but had no way to see which classes were actually open — course
  discovery was buried one level down at `/portal/classes`, and that page defaults its city
  filter to the family's own city, so a parent whose city had no open class saw a blank page.
  The Dashboard now surfaces up to 3 currently-open classes (with price, seats, start, venue,
  and a "Pay & lock a seat" CTA) directly on the landing page, right after Quick actions. It
  queries **every city** (`GET /class-seats/classes` with no `?city=`), so parents always see
  what is opening anywhere, then "See all classes" links to the full city-filtered browse.
  (portal-class-discovery-prd D-PCD-11.)

### Changed
- Extracted the bookable-class card (`ClassCard` + `AvailableClass` shape) out of
  `FindClassesPage` into shared `availableClasses.tsx` so the Dashboard panel and the
  Find-a-class page render an open class identically and share one query cache key.

## 2026-07-21 (feat: Art Studio draft auto-save + reopen-to-edit + readable tools — owner feedback)

### Added

- **Draft auto-save — every mode.** The working canvas AND the picture it's built on
  lived only in React state, so a refresh or leaving the studio lost an unsaved drawing.
  The vector ops + base picture now auto-save to `localStorage` (keyed by the bucket)
  and restore on return — free-play, reopened-picture, all of it; only missions opt out.
  A `hydrated` flag sequences restore-before-autosave so the empty mount can't wipe the
  draft it's about to load. Cleared when the canvas is emptied.
- **Reopen a saved picture to keep drawing.** My Pictures images get a "🎨 Keep drawing"
  action that reopens them on the Art Studio canvas as the base (loaded directly by
  id+project via the same-origin bytes proxy, so it works for a picture in any project);
  the kid draws on top and ✨ bring-to-life remixes it. Survives a refresh (base is in the
  draft).

### Changed

- Coach input is now a larger multi-line textarea (Enter sends, Shift+Enter for a newline)
  with Send on its own row — the old single-line box was pinched to ~80px.
- Each left-rail tool shows its name (Pencil / Crayon / Marker / Eraser / Fill / Stamp /
  Undo) under the icon — the emoji alone was unreadable.
- Stamp tool offers 24 stickers instead of 6.

## 2026-07-21 (feat: warn parents opening the app inside WeChat that the login/registration code won't arrive)

### Added
- **WeChat in-app browser notice on the parent auth screens.** Parents who open
  `app.airbotix.ai` from a link shared inside WeChat get stuck: WeChat's built-in webview
  suppresses the email one-time code and can't leave to the inbox, so the login/registration
  code "never arrives". A bilingual (中文 / English) warning banner now appears on
  `/portal/login`, `/portal/verify-otp`, and `/portal/register` **only when the UA is WeChat**
  (`MicroMessenger`), telling parents to tap `···` → **Open in Browser** and continue in
  Safari/Chrome, with a one-tap "copy link" button. New `isWeChatBrowser()` UA helper
  (`src/lib/inAppBrowser.ts`) + `WeChatBrowserNotice` component (`src/components/auth/`), both
  unit-tested. Renders nothing outside WeChat, so normal sign-in is unchanged.

## 2026-07-21 (fix: checkout shows the card form immediately — Airwallex HPP via SDK, no more two-step Pay screen)

### Fixed
- All four hosted checkouts (class seat, wallet top-up, per-session tutoring,
  academy product) now launch the Airwallex Hosted Payment Page through the
  Components SDK (`payments.redirectToCheckout`) on the intent the backend
  already created, so the payment form renders **up-front**. Previously we sent
  the browser to a hand-built `checkout.airwallex.com/#/standalone/checkout?...`
  deep link whose built-in UX hid the form behind a "Pay AUD" click
  (owner-reported). New shared `startHostedCheckout()` helper
  (`src/pages/portal/airwallex.ts`) launches via the SDK and **gracefully falls
  back** to the old `checkout_url` redirect whenever the SDK is unusable
  (blocked/offline, missing `client_secret`, or a non-Airwallex mock host) — so
  unit tests + the cross-repo harness (no CDN) keep today's behaviour and the
  flow can never regress. The same intent is used, so backend webhook
  reconciliation is untouched. Unit tests added (`airwallex.test.ts`).

### Changed
- Checkout response types carry optional `client_secret`.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added a development-only Journey to the West C1 runtime preview that uses the real Story Blocks parser, runner, editor, Flower Fruit Mountain background, and Stone Monkey asset without backend or production-data writes.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Art Studio picture gallery on the kid page — D-IS-5)

### Added
- **`/portal/family/:kidId/images`** — parent-facing Art Studio picture gallery
  (image-studio-prd.md D-IS-5): header totals (picture count, ★ spent summed from
  `metadata.stars_charged`, last-created relative date), responsive image grid
  grouped Today / This week / Earlier, click-through lightbox with the full
  prompt + timestamp + star cost, and a client-side "Export prompts" CSV
  (date,prompt,stars). Read-only oversight — deliberately no delete. Presigned
  view URLs are requested lazily per card via the existing
  `POST /projects/:id/artifacts/:artifactId/download-url`.
- Kid Growth page links to the gallery ("Art Studio pictures — see what {kid}
  made →") from its quick-links card.
- Pure helpers in `kidImages.ts` (bucketing, totals, RFC-4180 CSV) + component
  and unit tests (`KidImagesPage.test.tsx`, `kidImages.test.ts`).

### Fixed
- **Honest totals on a capped list.** The gallery now requests
  `?kind=image&limit=200` (the backend's maximum page; its default is 40) and,
  when the response comes back exactly that long, the header says
  "Showing the latest 200 pictures · N★ spent on these" instead of presenting a
  truncated count and star spend as if they were the all-time totals.
- The `/kids/:id` lookup failure no longer falls back to the fabricated name
  "Your kid" — the page shows a small notice and titles itself
  "Art Studio pictures" until the real nickname loads.
- `groupImages` / `gallerySummary` are memoised with `useMemo` so a 200-picture
  gallery doesn't regroup and re-total on every render.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Art Studio tool rail v2 + new-picture keeps the old artwork)

### Changed
- The left tool rail is TWO columns (owner feedback): column 1 = the tools,
  column 2 = only the picked tool's options — sticker grid for the stamp tool,
  colours for painting tools, and stroke-width preview DOTS (in the current
  ink) at the top instead of floating "S M L" letters.
- "+ new picture" now snapshots an unsaved drawing into My Pictures BEFORE
  resetting the canvas (原先的也保留) — also the first save path for a drawing
  that never summoned the AI.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Airbotix brand mark on the Art Studio bottom bar)

### Added
- The takes strip carries the Airbotix logo + surface name at its left edge —
  the immersive page hides the Learn nav, so the brand rides the bottom bar
  exactly like the Music Stage transport (owner call).

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Art Studio goes live — un-paused everywhere it shows)

### Changed
- Art Studio left the coming-soon list (owner call after the canvas-first
  rebuild): the Create tab now shows it as a live card, and the Workspace
  studio picker's Image card became a link-out to `/learn/create/image`
  (same pattern as Music -> the Stage; `?studio=image` deep links drop to the
  picker). The in-class create sheet keeps it excluded (`noClassSheet`) —
  missions are the class path for art.

## 2026-07-20 (fix: Portal default landing back to Dashboard)

### Changed
- **`/portal` (post-login default landing) is Dashboard again** — owner reversed QPCD-1
  (portal-class-discovery-prd.md v0.5): classes-first landing was never an owner decision.
  **Find a class** moves to `/portal/classes` (already its explicit path) and drops to
  second place in the nav drawer; `/portal/dashboard` redirects to `/portal` so old
  links keep working.
## 2026-07-20 (fix: Dashboard guide picks are English-first)

### Changed
- **Dashboard "Picked for your family" recommendations are English-first** (D-PFG-05):
  `selectRecommendedGuides` now ranks every `en-AU` guide above guides in other
  languages — the featured/city/age tiers apply within each language band — so 中文
  cards can no longer appear on the English Portal dashboard unless fewer than 3
  English guides exist (back-fill keeps the block from going empty). Fixes the
  2026-07-20 report of the dashboard surfacing 中文 guides on the English platform.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Family Guides default to English with an EN/中文 toggle)

### Changed
- `/portal/guides` now opens in **English by default** (D-PFG-04, resolves Q-PFG-3) with a
  prominent **English / 中文 toggle** replacing the language dropdown; the default keeps the
  URL clean while 中文 lands in `?language=zh-CN` like the other filters. Topic / location /
  age select options are scoped to the active language so they never dead-end across
  languages. Clear filters returns to the English catalogue.
## 2026-07-20 (fix: portal course list only shows courses actually on sale — D-6)

### Fixed
- The Portal course list showed every `is_published` pack, which is the LEARNING-side flag.
  Unpriced marketing drafts (and teaching-only packs like `ai-pet-lab-v1`, which is not a sold
  course at all) appeared to parents with a "Request a seat" button. Worse, they were dead
  ends: "See class times" calls `GET /courses/:slug/classes`, which 404s unless the course is
  `marketing_published`, so the parent got "No classes are open for online purchase yet" and
  was pushed back to the seat request — which then landed in the DB for a course with no price.
  The list now requests `/course-packs?bookable=true` (taught AND on sale); the backend rejects
  the enrolment independently.
- The Portal query key is now `['course-packs', 'bookable']`. It previously shared
  `['course-packs']` with the learn-side catalog, which lists every published pack — same key
  with different filters would have let whichever page loaded first serve its cache to the other.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Art Studio goes full-screen like Story Blocks)

### Changed
- `/learn/create/image` joins IMMERSIVE_ROUTES + AUTO_FULLSCREEN_ROUTES (owner
  call: 肯定是全屏,就跟 Story Blocks 一样) — Learn nav gone, no page scroll,
  auto browser-fullscreen on entry, own exit via "← All tools".

## 2026-07-20 (feat: 👤 My Characters + 🎮 use in my game)

### Added
- **My Characters** (image-studio-prd D-IS-23): name the active take → saved as a
  character (artifact metadata); a 👤 picker in the takes strip puts any saved
  character back on the canvas as the base — characters grow across sessions and
  pair with the build-on-yours mission template.
- **Use in my game** (D-IS-25, P4 v1): send the active take into one of your own
  game/code projects as a VFS asset (`assets/art/…`, direct-to-S3 + reference
  save — merge semantics, never clobbers the game). The Art Studio becomes the
  platform's asset forge; Story Blocks import stays a cross-studio follow-up.
- Canvas artifact pixels now load through the same-origin bytes proxy
  (D-IS-24) — kills S3-CORS taint on paint-over chaining and powers the game
  hand-off.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: 🪄 magic brush — paint the spot, say what it becomes)

### Added
- Region editing (image-studio-prd D-IS-18 ④ / P3a): once a magic take is on the
  canvas, the 🪄 Magic brush toggle lets the kid PAINT a pink highlight over the
  region to change and say what it becomes ("a golden crown") — sent as a mask
  (transparent = edit region) with the reference, one image-tier charge. The
  result lands as a new take; the highlight is never part of the picture.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: Art Studio P2 finish — draw-along, checklist look, story time)

### Added
- **Draw-along** (image-studio-prd D-IS-21): art missions can carry
  `steps_json.art.draw_along` steps — the task card walks the kid through them
  ("Step 1/3: a big circle for the body") and each step summons its own 2★
  ghost underlay. The core teach-to-draw mechanic.
- **Checklist-grounded 👀 look** (D-IS-20): with `steps_json.art.checklist`, the
  look asks the coach to tick which task elements it can SEE and what's missing —
  encouragement-only, element presence never quality.
- **📖 Story time (ignition ⑤, D-IS-18)**: after a magic take, a 1★ button asks
  the coach for a tiny story + name for the picture — the bridge toward Voice
  Booth reading and storybooks.

## 2026-07-20 (feat: add Tiny Star Village A4-D)

### Added
- Added Mission 15 with a required overshoot observation and a locked number-only
  `Right 4` to `Right 3` repair before saved rerun completion.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Portal Family Guides discovery layer)

### Added
- New Portal page **`/portal/guides` (Family Guides)** — parent-portal-family-guides-prd.md
  §5.1: card grid over the new `GET /portal/resource-guides` catalogue endpoint (cover,
  title, summary, location/age/language chips, verified date, featured badge), with
  topic / location / age / language filters reflected in the URL query. Cards and PDF
  buttons open the marketing-site reading pages in a new tab with `?src=portal`
  attribution; a friendly empty state links to `airbotix.ai/resources` (also `?src=portal`-attributed)
  when the endpoint is down (503) so the rest of the Portal is unaffected.
- Dashboard **"Family Guides — Picked for your family"** block (§5.2): 3 recommendations
  via a pure frontend selector — family city/state→locations match first, then featured
  guides matching the kids' ages (city/state and ages come from the already-cached family
  queries; no new API call), then remaining featured, then newest `lastVerified` — plus a
  "View all" link. Hidden entirely while loading or on endpoint failure.
- Onboarding getting-started checklist gains an optional **"Browse family guides"** item
  linking `/portal/guides` (new `guidesBrowsed` localStorage flag, same pattern as
  `limitsReviewed`).
- Portal nav drawer gains **Family Guides** between Tutoring and My Family.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: expand Academy Year 3 native question visuals)

### Added
- Added accessible native Year 3 table and solid-shape renderers with regression tests.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: add Tiny Star Village A4-B)

### Added
- Added Mission 14 with a locked three-block breakfast-cart chain where the child
  changes only the movement parameter, saves, and runs to the table.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Music Stage track editing, export and final pricing)

### Added
- Added per-track rename, octave, pan, WAV download and paid re-roll actions, plus
  whole-song mix-aware WAV export and a confirmation preview before real-song generation.

### Changed
- Music generation and re-rolls now cost 5★, real-song generation costs 15★,
  Voice Booth costs 5★, Art Studio costs 9★ and Video Studio costs 60★.
- Playback and real-song prompts now honour mute, solo, volume, pan and octave settings.
## 2026-07-19 (fix: replace the Fable Forest placeholder with Alice)

### Changed
- The Story Blocks collection shelf now shows the planned **Alice in Wonderland** classic
  adventure instead of the unrelated **Fable Forest** placeholder, matching the curriculum and
  marketing display name while keeping the collection visibly unavailable.
## 2026-07-17 (chore: pricing ladder final — labels + music-real model)

### Changed
- 🎧 Make it real now bills as its own **`music-real` model (15⭐)** — `generateRealSong`
  sends `model: 'music-real'`; `REAL_SONG_COST_STARS` = 15. Score actions (compose / edit /
  card / re-roll) settle at **5⭐** after the owner's final "整体太低" uplift.
- All price labels re-synced to the final ladder (star-pricing-sot.md): Voice Booth 1★→**5★**,
  Art Studio 8★→**9★**, Video Studio 5★→**60★** (was badly mislabelled vs the backend 40★,
  now 60★), Create-hub cards to match (music 5 / image 9 / voice 5 / video 60).

## 2026-07-17 (chore: music pricing 3 -> 5 stars)

### Changed
- `MUSIC_GENERATION_COST_STARS` / `REAL_SONG_COST_STARS` raised 3⭐ → **5⭐** to match the
  backend `music-default` price bump (owner decision: music was underpriced). The lane
  `⋯` Re-roll menu label now derives from the constant instead of a hardcoded string.

## 2026-07-17 (feat: Music Stage track editing & export — track-editing PRD v0.1)

### Added
- **Lane `⋯` actions now ACT** (they were shells that just opened the legacy Mixer region):
  **✏️ Edit** opens an inline drawer — rename, octave shift ±2 (melodic lanes; live at the
  next note, drums excluded), stereo pan — all 0⭐, keyed by instrument kind so they survive
  version switches; **↓ Download track** renders that ONE stem client-side (`Tone.Offline`
  + fallback voices → 16-bit WAV, zero network, zero stars); **🔄 Re-roll −3⭐** fires a
  single-track regeneration through the structured `rerollTrack` DTO field the backend
  already supported (version pill `🔄 <Track>`).
- **↓ Song** on the transport bar — the whole mix exported as `{title}.wav`, honouring
  mute/solo/style=None/volume/pan/octave exactly as the stage plays it (`offlineRender.ts`).
- **🎧 Make it real is now two-step**: the confirm popover shows "The AI will hear: …" —
  the exact provider prompt, mix included — before the 3⭐ call fires.
- DEV-build "fake AI" badge on the transport bar: local stacks run the deterministic mock
  LLM, whose freeform edits return the same fixture song — named so it stops reading as
  "the AI ignored me".

### Changed
- **The stage mix now reaches the real-song provider** (`buildRealSongPrompt`): muted and
  style=None instruments leave the featuring list, a solo becomes "featuring mainly the …",
  VOL ≤0.4 / ≥0.98 read as "quiet/prominent <instrument>". Previously VOL/mute/solo were
  ignored — recording after mixing produced the identical song.
- `useScorePlayback` accepts per-instrument tweaks: pan pushes live into each `Tone.Channel`,
  octave transposes at trigger time (mid-playback safe).

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Art Studio is ONE conversation — no more form page)

### Changed
- The Art Studio page is now a single chat stream (owner call: 不是表单+聊天框,
  整个体验就是对话): the paint-plan card renders as a message IN the stream, the
  finished picture arrives as an image bubble IN the stream, and after a picture
  exists the same input flips between "🖌 Change this picture −9★" (remix via
  ref_artifact_id) and "💬 Plan something new −1★" (coach). The "Your recent
  images" gallery grid / "Empty canvas" block is REMOVED from the page — history
  lives in My Pictures (footer link to the bucket project).

## 2026-07-19 (feat: expand Academy Year 3 native question visuals)

### Added
- Added accessible native Year 3 table and solid-shape renderers with regression tests.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Academy exam products and native practice)

### Added
- Academy is sold and opened as a fixed exam/year/subject product. Kids see only products
  unlocked for them, and the practice player has no year switcher.
- Parent Academy catalog, checkout/order confirmation, kid exam library, and fixed-product
  practice routes.
- Accessible native renderers for deterministic exam visuals, including tally tables,
  equal groups, clocks, solid shapes, coin collections, shape matrices, and symbol patterns.

### Tests
- Academy component coverage plus the cross-repo purchase, child-scoped entitlement,
  12-question answer, DB read-back, and 390px mobile journey.

## 2026-07-19 (fix: deflake Story Blocks close-button queries in CI)

### Fixed
- `BlocksStudioPage.test.tsx`: six `getByRole('button', { name: 'Close story
  mission' })` queries fired synchronously right after `renderStudio()` — on
  slow CI runners the button hasn't rendered yet (main went red on A3-D after
  an unrelated merge reshuffled vitest sharding). All now use the file's own
  `await screen.findByRole` pattern. Suite passes locally isolated + full.

## 2026-07-17 (feat: Art Studio coach chat shows its 1★ price)

### Changed
- The Art Studio coach chat is now billed per turn (owner rule
  `rules/ai-star-billing.md`): the Send button reads "Send −1★" (matches the backend
  `kids-default` text-turn price) and each coach turn refreshes the wallet balance.

## 2026-07-17 (feat: Art Studio plan-first interaction — 想/画/改)

### Changed
- The Art Studio now opens as a **conversation with an art coach** (owner call: plan first,
  never straight to generation). The FREE coach chat (`POST /llm/image-plan`) asks one short
  question at a time with tap-chips (WHO/WHERE/FEELING), then produces an **editable plan
  card** — the only 8★ moment; "Skip the chat — just paint it" builds a plan from what the
  kid already said. After making, a **"Change it"** bar remixes the fresh picture via
  `ref_artifact_id` (image-to-image, 8★). Recent grid and My Pictures auto-save unchanged.
- `ImageMakerPage.test.tsx` rewritten for the new flow (free chat → plan card with
  project_id → celebration → remix with ref_artifact_id → skip-to-paint).

## 2026-07-17 (feat: Art Studio rebuild — bucket auto-save, real prices, rename)

### Added
- Create studios (image/voice/video) now resolve the kid's per-tool system bucket
  (`useCreateBucket` → `POST /kids/:id/create-buckets/resolve`) and every generation
  carries its `project_id`, so the backend persists an S3 `Artifact` — creations
  finally SURVIVE a reload (learn-create-studio-save-prd.md §5, D-CSS-01/02).
- New shared hooks in `useStudio.ts`: `useCreateBucket`, `useBucketArtifacts`
  (Recent = bucket contents, D-CSS-03 — music and voice audio no longer mix),
  `useArtifactUrl` (signed download URL as a proper query).
- `ImageMakerPage.test.tsx`: bucket resolve + `project_id` on generate + celebration +
  bucket-based Recent + real 8★ price label (the create/ pages' first tests).

### Changed
- **"Image Maker" renamed to "Art Studio"** (kid-facing display strings only —
  route `/learn/create/image`, files and enums unchanged; image-studio-prd.md v0.2).
  Applies to the Create-tab tile, page chrome, project-drawer title, and the Portal
  growth copy ("Art Studio").
- Art Studio size presets now show the real generated dims (1024×1024 / 1536×1024 /
  1024×1536 — the old 512×512 etc. were never true) and the make button shows the
  real backend charge (8★, was mislabelled 4★).
- Generation success in the Art Studio now fires the celebration (was silent — the
  only studio missing `onSuccess`).
- `ImageTile`/`AudioRow`/`VideoTile` no longer fire API requests inside the render
  body (render-purity fix) — they use the shared `useArtifactUrl` query.
- Studio "Recent" headers now state where work is saved ("saved to My Pictures ✓").
- Removed `useRecentArtifacts` (cross-project `/kids/:id/artifacts?kind=` feed) in
  favour of bucket reads.
## 2026-07-19 (fix: transient refresh failures no longer log the user out — 2026-07-18 incident)

### Fixed
- **A rate-limited or briefly-unreachable `/auth/refresh` no longer kills the session**
  (both principals: parent `user` + kid). `api.ts` treated every refresh failure as
  session death, so when a whole venue behind one egress IP hit the backend's old
  60/h/IP refresh limit (2026-07-18 incident) everyone was mass-logged-out. Now only a
  refresh 401/403 (cookie truly dead) — or a replay that still 401s on a fresh token —
  clears the session; 429/5xx/network keep it, with one 1.5s-backoff retry on 5xx/network
  to ride out deploy windows. Backend fix lands separately (session-keyed refresh
  throttle, platform-backend `auth-throttlers.ts`).
- Tests: new `src/lib/api.test.ts` — 429 keeps session, refresh-401 clears it, successful
  refresh replays the request, 5xx retries once then succeeds, network×2 keeps session,
  fresh-token-still-401 clears.

### Fixed
- **Table/graph questions now show the image, not garbled text.** Questions whose data
  lives in a figure (a table of values, a bar graph, a grid, a clock) were being rendered
  from flattened, noisy extracted text — and PDF-layout extraction occasionally bled the
  next question's text in. `AcademyPracticePage` now detects these (figure keywords or >1
  question mark + an available image) and renders the scanned question image instead, with
  generic A–D options (the choices live in the image). Prose questions still render as text.
# Changelog

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Art Studio P2 — Mission Mode + canvas templates)

### Added
- **Mission Mode** (image-studio-prd D-IS-20): art missions (Mission.steps_json.art)
  open the Art Studio with a 🚀 task card in the coach rail; work saves to a
  mission-linked project (created lazily, teacher-visible via the existing class
  chain) instead of the free-play bucket; "🚀 Turn it in! +3★" submits through the
  existing acceptance flow (must_have_kinds) and celebrates completion. Backend
  untouched — the pack endpoint already returns full mission rows.
- **Canvas templates** (D-IS-22): a mission template renders as an immutable
  underlay (color-it/copy-it, 35% alpha, excluded from export) or as the base
  layer (populate-it, included in export unless magic='strokes-only').
- PackLessonsPage routes art missions straight into the studio with the mission
  context; non-art missions keep the existing ProjectNewPage flow.

## 2026-07-19 (feat: Art Studio P1 — canvas-first studio: 孩子的手在前,AI 的魔法在后)

### Added
- The Art Studio is now a CANVAS studio (image-studio-prd v0.9, D-IS-11…19):
  four zones (left tool rail · center canvas · right AI coach rail · bottom
  takes film-strip). Stroke-list engine on `perfect-freehand` + `lazy-brush`
  (MIT): 6 chunky brushes (pencil/crayon/marker/eraser/fill/stamps), Apple
  Pencil pressure, undo, hi-res PNG export.
- Three kid-triggered AI ignitions with price tags (rules/ai-star-billing.md):
  👻 "Sketch it for me" −2★ (faint erasable trace-me underlay, never exported),
  👀 "Coach, look!" −1★ (vision on the canvas, one encouraging suggestion),
  ✨ "Bring it to life" −9★ (uploads the kid's OWN canvas as the ref → the
  magic preserves their composition; empty canvas = pure-generation on-ramp).
- Takes film-strip: magic results are NEW takes and never replace the sketch;
  hold-to-compare shows the kid's hand-drawn original; ＋new starts a fresh
  picture; everything persists to My Pictures.

### Changed
- The conversational ImageMakerPage is replaced by `art/ArtStudioPage` at
  `/learn/create/image` (the coach chat lives on as the AI-rail sidekick).

## 2026-07-18 (fix: shared-link background music — audio MIME in srcdoc inliner)

### Fixed
- **Background music (and anything the game gates on it) now plays on public `/play/:shareId`
  links.** The srcdoc asset inliner's `ASSET_MIME` map (`buildPreview.ts`) had no audio rows,
  so a frozen share snapshot's raw-base64 `.mp3`/`.wav`/`.ogg`/`.m4a` inlined as
  `data:application/octet-stream` — and data: URLs are never MIME-sniffed, so
  `new Audio()` refused the source. In the reported game the on-beat note spawner checked
  `backgroundMusic.paused`, so the missing music also made all incoming notes vanish. The
  authed studio never hit this because `codeApi.toStudioContent` (whose `BINARY_ASSET_MIME`
  does know audio) wraps assets before the builder runs; the public play fetch bypasses it.
  Added `wav/mp3/ogg/m4a` to `ASSET_MIME` (mirroring backend `asset-kinds.ts`) + cross-sync
  comments on both maps. Existing share links are fixed on deploy — snapshots store raw
  base64; the MIME is derived at render time.
- Tests: `buildGamePreview.test` — raw-base64 mp3 inlines as `data:audio/mpeg` (never
  octet-stream) + all four audio extensions map to real `audio/*` MIMEs.
## 2026-07-18 (fix: Creative Code Studio — manual edits no longer revert after AI activity; Time Machine reverts stick)

### Fixed
- **Manual code edits no longer silently revert seconds after AI activity** (Creative Code
  Studio, PRD learn-game-studio-prd.md J3 revised). Four separate races made a stale server
  snapshot land on top of newer local work:
  1. **Saves now single-flight** (`PlaygroundApp`): overlapping `flushSave` calls (debounce
     timer + pre-turn flush + asset import + exit) serialized through one promise chain, and
     a direct flush cancels the pending debounce tick — the client can no longer 409 against
     itself and "resolve" the phantom conflict destructively.
  2. **A 409 save conflict now keeps the kid's LIVE copy** (`projectPersistence`): the save
     retries the local files on the server's adopted version; the server's conflicting copy
     drops into the Time Machine ("Kept your newest copy" — now literally true). Previously
     the code adopted the *server* files over the live editor, reverting the kid's work. A
     double conflict adopts the server counter and stays queued (no loop).
  3. **AI/fix turns merge per-path instead of wholesale-replacing the VFS**
     (`vfsOps.mergeTurnFiles` via `applyTurnFiles`): the turn wins only on the paths it
     changed; a hand-edit committed while the turn (or a server-side auto-fix) was in
     flight survives.
  4. **A late auto-fix verdict can no longer clobber newer local work** (`useVerification`):
     each verification chain records the projectStore mutation seq at arm time; a `fixing`
     verdict arriving after any local mutation (hand-edit, file op, Time Machine revert) is
     discarded — resume-verify picks the still-pending turn up on the next open.
  5. **The idle autosave commits over the LIVE store files** (`CodeEditorPane.commitDrafts`):
     the 1.2 s idle timer's closure could predate an AI apply, so its commit wholesale-
     reverted the turn's changes; it now reads `useProjectStore.getState().files` at fire time.
- **Time Machine "Go back" no longer ends up half-undone**: the revert flushes its save
  immediately (bypassing the 600 ms debounce) so the reverted state reaches the server before
  any in-flight writer, and the verification staleness guard (above) stops a late fix turn
  from stomping the reverted files.
- Tests: `projectPersistence.test` (local-wins retry, double-conflict adopt+queued, retry→4xx),
  new `vfsOps.mergeTurnFiles.test`, `useVerification.test` staleness-guard cases;
  `useGameAgent.test` apply assertions carry the changed-paths arg.

## 2026-07-17 (feat: teacher-prep immediate share-link — D-PREP-6)

### Added
- **Teacher-prep game/blocks studios can create an external play-link in one click,
  with no grown-up approval** (teacher-prep-projects-prd.md D-PREP-6). The prep host
  (`TeacherPrepStudioPage`) now passes a `prepMode` flag into the shared studios;
  threaded `PlaygroundApp → Workspace → Taskbar → ShareLinkPanel` (game) and
  `BlocksStudioPage → BlocksSharePanel` (blocks). In prep mode the share control drops
  the kid "Ask my grown-up to share" copy for a one-click **"Create share link"**, shows
  an adult "no sign-in needed" citizenship note, and never renders the pending/waiting
  beat — the backend returns an `active` link straight from the request (no parent gate).
  Web Code (`code`) prep has no share/play surface, so no control appears there. Kid share
  flow (parent-approval-gated) is unchanged.
- Tests: `ShareLinkPanel.test` + new `BlocksSharePanel.test` (prep adult copy + one-click
  active, no pending beat; kid copy unchanged).

## 2026-07-17 (change: "Free during workshop" AI cost UI — D-WFA-01)

### Added
- **Studios now show "Free during workshop" instead of a star cost while a project's
  free-workshop window is live (workshop-free-ai-prd.md D-WFA-01).** The backend already
  returns `ai_free_now` on `GET /projects/:id` and waives all AI star charges regardless of
  the UI; this threads that flag into the kid studios so the cost display + the low/zero-balance
  gate match reality. New shared `FreeBadge` pill (K-12 `wash-mint` token) marks the free state.
- **Creative Code Studio (`CodeChat`):** the Ask button reads `✨ Ask · Free` (no `−2★`), never
  disables on a low/zero balance, and the `{stars}★ left` hint becomes `🎉 Free during workshop`.
  Wired through `useCodeStudio` (`aiFreeNow`) → `CodeStudioPage` → `CodeChat`.
- **Game playground (`AIChatPanel`):** the metered Stars badge is replaced with a "🎉 Free during
  workshop" badge. Wired via `PlaygroundApp` (reads `ai_free_now` on the same `getProject` that
  loads the engine) → `Workspace` → `AIChatPanel`.
- **Project-scoped creative studios (`ProjectDetailPage` → Image/Voice/Music/Story/Video
  `*StudioContent`):** each generate button shows the `Free` badge in place of its `N★` cost
  when the project's free-workshop window is live.
- Tests: `CodeChat.aiFreeNow.test`, `AIChatPanel.test` (free-workshop badge block),
  `ImageStudioContent.aiFreeNow.test`.

### Changed
- Added `ai_free_now?: boolean` to the `CodeProject` (codeApi) and `Project` (ProjectDetailPage)
  types so the field flows through the existing project fetches.
## 2026-07-17 (feat: walk-in workshop kids — restricted Learn + kid-code claim in Portal)

### Added
- **Restricted Learn surface for walk-in (unclaimed) workshop kids** (auth-system-prd
  §5.2.1): nav trims to **My Classes + 🎟️ My code**; catalog surfaces (`/learn` home,
  Projects list/new, Create, Lessons catalog, AI Workspace) bounce to `/learn/classroom`
  (`LearnLayout.isRestrictedForWalkIn`); deep working routes (studios, project/mission
  detail) stay open so class missions are never blocked. `normaliseMe` now forwards
  `is_ephemeral`/`claim_code` onto `KidPrincipal`.
- **Kid-code card on the Learn profile**: an unclaimed kid sees their claim code big +
  copyable ("give this to your parent — it never expires"); gone once claimed.
- **Claim a walk-in kid in the Portal**: the register wizard's first-kid step gains
  **"I have a kid code from a workshop"** (code + real age + new PIN; a failed claim
  never fails registration — the success screen says to retry from Family → Add kid),
  and `/portal/family/new` gains an **"I have a kid code"** tab (shared `ClaimKidForm`,
  409 nickname-collision retry with override).

### Fixed
- Kid-age minimums in the register + add-kid forms aligned to the backend (6, D-SP8) —
  they allowed 4–5 and the backend rejected the submit.


## 2026-07-17 (change: Creative Code Studio jumps straight to the game prompt)

### Changed
- **Creating a Creative Code Studio project now goes straight to the game playground
  prompt, skipping the second-level menu.** Every create entry-point — the Create tab
  card, the Learn-home "Creative Code Studio" card, the in-class "Create for this class"
  sheet, and the class games-wall "Make a game" CTA — now routes directly to the
  prompt-first `/learn/playground/new` (carrying `?class=<id>` in class contexts) instead
  of the `/learn/create/code` "pick a starting point" hub or the class sheet's Web Code /
  game sub-menu. `CREATE_TOOLS`' Creative Code Studio entry is now `to:/learn/playground/new`,
  `projectKind:'game'`.
- **The unimplemented web-code entries are hidden, not removed.** The `/learn/create/code`
  `CodeHubPage` route and its `Tiny Game`/website/tool templates, and the
  `CreateForClassSheet` **Web Code** sub-type, stay in code (still reachable as deep-links —
  the cross-repo harness enters the game via `hub-template-pong`). The class sheet now shows
  a second-level menu only when **more than one** sub-type is visible; with Web Code hidden,
  Creative Code Studio jumps directly into the single visible game sub-type. A course that
  allows only `code` (not `game`) therefore shows no Creative Code Studio tool for now.
  Covered by `CreateForClassSheet.test` + `HomePage.test`; harness `kid-game-save`.

## 2026-07-17 (docs: README troubleshooting pointer)

### Added
- README quick start: troubleshooting note — "buttons do nothing" in local dev is
  almost always a backend 500 (local Postgres down; `/health` still 200), with the
  diagnosis chain linked in umbrella `rules/local-dev-environment.md`.

## 2026-07-17 (chore: pause Image Maker / Voice Booth / Video Studio as "Coming soon")

### Changed
- **Image Maker, Voice Booth and Video Studio are paused on owner request** (output
  quality isn't there yet). A per-tool `comingSoon` flag in the shared create-tool
  registry (`src/pages/learn/create/createTools.ts`) now drives every surface:
  - **Create tab** (`/learn/create`): the three tools moved to a non-clickable
    "Coming soon" teaser section below the live tools (Story Blocks, Creative Code
    Studio, Music Stage — now listed first); the skills Tip line mentions live
    studios only.
  - **"Create for this class" sheet**: paused tools are never offered, even when the
    course allows `creative` kinds.
  - **Workspace studio picker**: Image / Voice / Video render as non-interactive
    "Coming soon" teasers; no new session can start, and the `?studio=` deep-link
    param is ignored for paused studios. Existing sessions still open.
  - **Learn home**: the Studios and Workspace card copy no longer advertises
    image/voice/video.
  - **Parent Portal onboarding** (`WelcomeWizard`): the "what your child will make"
    slide now leads with Story Blocks / Music / Code & Games and marks image, voice
    & video as coming soon.
  - The `/learn/create/{image,voice,video}` **routes stay registered** (deep links +
    harness wallet journeys), so flipping `comingSoon` off restores everything —
    nothing was deleted.

## 2026-07-17 (chore: hide the self-serve Lessons catalog behind a feature switch)

### Changed
- The kid-facing Lessons catalog (`/learn/missions` — the course-pack browser fed by
  `GET /course-packs` — and its per-pack detail page) is temporarily hidden on owner
  request via a new `SHOW_LESSONS_CATALOG` switch (`src/lib/features.ts`), because the
  seeded official course-pack content is not ready for self-serve browsing. The switch
  removes the top-bar **Lessons** entry, the home **Guided courses** card, and the
  My Classes empty-state **Browse lessons →** CTA, and redirects both `/learn/missions`
  routes to `/learn`. Nothing was deleted — flipping the switch back to `true` restores
  the whole surface. Copy-split guard and home tests are now switch-aware.

## 2026-07-16 (feat: add a structural picture-first If condition)

### Added
- Story Blocks now has a real C-shaped `If touching` container. A child chooses another character
  and places multiple actions in its visibly nested body. There is no separate `End if` block.
- The editor provides a touch-first character picker, the saved project preserves the selected
  character ID, and old one-action Junior If projects migrate without changing their behavior.

### Changed
- Refined the low-age If container into a lighter control spine with a labelled `Then do` pocket.
  Nested actions, the add affordance and the active insertion state now have separate visual zones,
  and the insertion prompt points children to the block palette on the left.
- Replaced the dashed web-style add button with a tactile connector control that shares the
  blocks' border, depth and press feedback without pretending to be an executable block.
- Integrated the `If touch` condition directly into the orange C-frame header, removing the
  duplicate raised block surface while preserving its tap-to-choose and whole-If drag behavior.

### Tests
- Added parser migration, nested-body store behavior, C-container rendering, editor target-picker,
  and multi-action true/false runtime coverage.

## 2026-07-17 (fix: Creative Code Studio Time Machine — AI turns now add save points)

### Fixed
- **The Code Editor's Time Machine now adds a save point for every AI turn, named by the
  backend's kid-readable label.** The turn result has always carried a `history_label`
  ("Made a change", "Added a pause button"), but the studio never recorded it: only manual
  edits snapshotted (the editor's idle autosnapshot on dirty drafts + file-tree ops), and an
  applied AI turn refreshes the editor's drafts to the committed content *without* marking them
  dirty — so the idle autosnapshot never fired for it. A game built purely by prompting never
  grew past its "Your game started here" entry. Most visible in **teacher-prep projects**, which
  are built prompt-first (teachers iterate almost entirely via 0-Stars chat turns) — the reported
  bug. `Workspace.onTurnApplied` (the one seam every applied turn passes through) now records a
  checkpoint via `historyStore`; a no-op question turn (no file change) is deduped away and a
  read-only teacher viewer never records.
- **AI save points can be named after what was asked.** The entry is titled by the backend's
  authored `history_label` ("Added a pause button"); when that label is generic or absent
  (e.g. the fake LLM's "Made a change", or a bland real turn), it falls back to the triggering
  prompt — the message the kid typed or the next-step chip they tapped — tidied to one short,
  capitalized line (`aiCheckpointLabel`). So a turn from "make the player jump higher" reads
  "Make the player jump higher" in the Time Machine instead of "Made a change". The prompt is
  threaded to the recorder via `useGameAgent`'s `onTurnApplied(result, { prompt })` seam.

### Changed
- **Time Machine entries are named from an authored label, not by reverse-parsing a technical
  summary.** `Checkpoint` gains an explicit `label` + semantic `kind`
  (`initial|edit|file|revert|kept-newest|ai`); `HistoryPanel` renders the `label` verbatim with a
  `kind`-driven icon instead of sniffing the `summary` string (which mangled friendly AI labels,
  e.g. "Made a change" → "Changed a change"). `describe()` is kept as the legacy fallback for
  checkpoints persisted before `label`/`kind` existed; the initial-version, kept-newest and revert
  records now pass explicit `label`+`kind`. New fields are optional → old cached checkpoints still
  render.

### Tests
- `historyStore.test.ts`: authored `label`/`kind` stored verbatim; a plain auto edit leaves them
  undefined; an AI turn identical to the latest snapshot dedupes to null; a coalesced typing burst
  keeps the session's label/kind.
- New `HistoryPanel.test.tsx`: an AI turn's `history_label` renders verbatim (never mangled), a
  legacy checkpoint (no label/kind) still derives a title from its summary, one entry per checkpoint.
- Harness `kid-game-edit-after-turn` now also asserts an applied AI turn adds a 'Made a change'
  Time Machine entry (the positive case beside the existing kept-newest regression).

## 2026-07-17 (fix: game-player pause/mute silences background music started via a bare Audio element)

### Fixed
- **Pause and mute in the game player now stop background music that a game plays through a bare
  `new Audio(src)` element it never adds to the page.** The engine-agnostic `AUDIO_CONTROL` shim
  (`buildGamePreview.ts`) suspends/mutes every `AudioContext` and every `<audio>/<video>` it can
  find, but it only found media via `document.querySelectorAll('audio,video')` — so a looping BGM
  track created with `new Audio('song.mp3'); a.loop = true; a.play()` and never appended to the DOM
  was invisible to it and kept playing straight through pause and mute. The shim now also patches
  `HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play` to track every element that plays (DOM-attached or not) and
  drives mute/pause across that set too.
- The shim also remembers the latest mute/pause intent, so audio that **starts after** the kid
  already muted or paused (a lazily-created `AudioContext`, a BGM track that begins on a later
  scene) is born silenced too — not only what was already playing.

### Tests
- Extended `buildGamePreview.audioControl.test.ts`: a bare `new Audio()` never added to the DOM is
  muted and paused; a detached track that only starts after mute is born silent; a WebAudio context
  created after mute is born with its master gain at 0. Refreshed the `buildGamePreview` srcdoc
  snapshot for the expanded shim.

## 2026-07-16 (fix: class/course assets load in the game via a same-origin bytes proxy)

### Fixed
- **A referenced class/course asset now actually loads in the game.** In teacher prep (and the kid
  playground), referencing a shared asset by `assets/class/<name>` logged
  `[airbotix] Texture failed to load: assets/class/<name>` and the asset never rendered: the runtime
  resolver read the bytes with a cross-origin `fetch()` of the signed S3 `download_url`, which fails
  without media-bucket CORS (the `<img>` preview kept working because image loads ignore CORS), so
  the sandboxed game was left with a bare path it couldn't resolve. `useReferencedClassAssets` now
  fetches the bytes **same-origin** from the backend proxy
  `GET /projects/:id/class-assets/:assetId/bytes` (class-shared-assets-prd D-CSA-11).
- The Class-tab **3D-model preview** (`ClassModelThumb` / `ClassModelStage`) had the same latent
  cross-origin failure (it `fetch()`ed the model bytes) — both now use the same-origin proxy.

### Changed
- `playgroundApi`: `fetchAssetDataUrl(url)` → `fetchClassAssetDataUrl(projectId, assetId)` (fetches
  via the proxy) + a shared `blobToDataUrl` helper; `lib/api` gains `apiBlob` (authenticated
  same-origin binary fetch, now also backing `apiDownload`).

### Tests
- Updated `classAssetResolver.test.ts` (resolver fetches by `(projectId, assetId)`),
  `playgroundApi.test.ts` (`fetchClassAssetDataUrl` hits the proxy, never the signed URL), and
  `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx` (model preview mock).

## 2026-07-17 (feat: make parent and kid sign-in unmistakable)

### Changed
- Rebuilt the shared sign-in experience around an explicit first question — **Parent or
  guardian** or **Kid creator** — with the active identity, its credential type, and a direct
  route switch visible before either form.
- Parent sign-in now says **Parent login or sign up** and explains that a new family
  is set up after the same email-code step, removing the hidden-registration ambiguity.
- Added an original robot platform-world scene and a responsive split layout that keeps the
  identity choice prominent on desktop, tablet, and phone widths.
- The desktop sign-in gateway now fills the entire viewport. Its game-world rail is fixed at
  100% height while the right-hand form owns its scrolling, so switching between the shorter
  parent form and taller kid form never offsets the family artwork.
- Elevated the full-screen gateway from a plain split screen to a premium editorial treatment:
  a bright fixed game stage, framed platform artwork, role-tinted ambient canvas, translucent form
  panel, refined segmented identity control, focus lighting, and reduced-motion-safe animation.
- The game stage now doubles as an Airbotix creation showcase, rotating through three curated
  course worlds every eight seconds with manual pagination, pause/play control, and a static
  experience for visitors who prefer reduced motion.
## 2026-07-17 (feat: add Tiny Star Village A3-S)

### Added
- Added saved character choice, one child-authored tap response, and real-run completion evidence for Mission 12.

## 2026-07-15 (feat: Tiny Star partners become responsive story characters)

### Changed
- **Character dialogue is calm instead of uncanny.** Lumi and Tuan Tuan now keep a friendly,
  stable smile while speaking instead of looping the mouth open and closed. Lumi waves once, and
  both puppets keep only the natural slow blink while a speech bubble is visible.
- **The Tiny Star Village collection hero gives each partner their own space.** Lumi now stands on
  the left and Tuan Tuan on the right with a clear gap between them at desktop and phone widths,
  rather than overlapping into one unreadable character silhouette.
- **Lumilo is no longer a permanently closed-eye picture that only slides around the stage.** The
  Tiny Star Village tutorial, in-studio coach, editable stage, and read-only player now share one
  canonical layered SVG puppet with open-eyed idle/blink, listening, movement, hop, speech,
  thinking, resting, and arms-up success performances. Running blocks drive those performances,
  so the character visibly explains the same cause-and-effect the child is programming.
- **Tuan Tuan now uses the same performance contract in Chapter 2.** The cloud bear opens their
  eyes by default, looks toward the route, walks with a soft step and scarf swish, speaks, thinks,
  rests only when asked, and raises both arms after the saved program reaches the plaza target.
- **The Story Blocks collection and chapter list now introduces the real partners.** Tiny Star
  Village, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and the world hero scene use the same open-eyed Lumi and Tuan Tuan
  puppets as the tutorial and stage instead of generic star/cloud emoji placeholders.
- A completed mission can be replayed after reload: pressing Go on the still-correct saved program
  reopens the evidence card and full-screen celebration instead of silently running underneath it.
- Reduced-motion mode keeps every meaningful expression and final state while disabling repeated
  character motion. Generic and legacy character images continue to render unchanged.

## 2026-07-15 (change: pause AI asset generation in Creative Code Studio)

### Changed
- **AI asset generation is disabled behind a feature flag (`featureFlags.ASSET_GENERATION_ENABLED`,
  default `false`).** The kid-facing ENTRY POINTS are now hidden/short-circuited: the Asset Viewer's
  ✨ Generate bar and Remix bar don't render, and a chat message classified as an "asset" request
  falls through to a normal game-code turn instead of generating (no `POST /llm/generate-asset`).
  No generation code was removed — the `assetGen` seam, `generationStore`, the backend endpoint and
  the guided demo all stay intact, so flipping the flag back to `true` fully restores the feature.
  The public `/try/playground` marketing demo is unaffected (it drives an offline art seam and
  bypasses the flag). The Asset Viewer still browses/imports/previews assets and the shared Library.

## 2026-07-15 (fix: the unsent playground chat draft survives a split-tab switch)

### Fixed
- **Creative Code Studio kept an unsent chat message only until you looked away.** In split mode,
  typing into the Airo composer and then flipping to the Assets (or Code / Guide) tab and back
  discarded the draft — the chat pane unmounts on a tab switch and the composer text lived in that
  pane's local state (user-reported). The draft is now lifted into `Workspace` (which stays mounted
  for the whole project, exactly like the chat history already is), so an unsent message survives
  split-tab and Window⇄Split switches for as long as the kid is in the project; it clears on send
  and resets when a different project opens.

## 2026-07-14 (feat: typed text edits the current song — the composer gets an edit mode)

### Added
- **"✏️ Change this song" — typed freeform edits on the Music Stage (D-MS10).** Only the five
  suggestion cards could iterate on the current song; typing in the composer always composed from
  scratch ("每次都是从零 Compose" — user-reported, with Suno's edit-on-existing flow as the
  reference). Once a song is on stage the composer now defaults to edit mode: the kid's words ride
  the request WITH the current score (`existingScore`, same backend path/price as the cards), the
  take lands as a `✏️ Edit` version, and "✨ New song" switches back to a from-scratch compose.

### Changed
- **The composer input is a real textarea now** (Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks a line; prompt cap
  120→240 chars) and edit mode puts the idea chips + genre pills away — together they answer
  "输入空间太少了". The input clears itself after a take lands.

## 2026-07-14 (fix: Music is discoverable from the studio picker again)
## 2026-07-14 (feat: Academy — NAPLAN Maths practice in the Learn SPA)

### Added
- **Academy — NAPLAN Maths practice (`/learn/academy`).** A new kid Learn surface: pick a year
  level (Year 3/5/7/9, default Year 5; subject fixed to Numeracy), work through ~20 real
  NAPLAN-style questions one at a time, and get the official answer straight after each try. Renders
  the real question text with inline figure images when present, falling back to the scanned
  question/page image otherwise; multiple-choice shows the real option text and submits the letter,
  value questions take a typed number. A header scoreboard tracks done/correct + progress, and the
  end-of-set summary reads back the kid's running accuracy with a "Practise more" reset. Rides the
  shared `api` client (kid-JWT auth) + K-12 design tokens like every other Learn page; a new home
  tile links to it.

### Fixed
- **The Workspace studio picker had no Music entry at all.** When the Stage moved out of the chat
  shell (D-MS7) the music card was removed from the picker, leaving the Create-hub 🎵 card as the
  only discoverable entry — a kid (or owner) standing in front of "What do you want to make with
  AI?" found no music (user-reported). The card is back, but as a LINK to `/learn/music` (the
  Stage) with an "Opens your own stage →" hint — picking it never creates a chat-shell session.

## 2026-07-14 (feat: Tiny Star Village chapter 2 missions)

### Added
- Added the Tiny Star Village A2-B and A2-D Story Blocks missions with real direction editing, exact run/save completion gates, and focused behavioural coverage.
- Added the Story Journey map and catalog so completed and upcoming Tiny Star Village scenes have a child-facing progression surface.

### Changed
- Extended the Story Blocks hub, mission guide, coach, starter registry, persistence state, and studio controls for the chapter 2 direction workflow.

## 2026-07-14 (fix: the Music Stage no longer auto-enters OS fullscreen)

### Fixed
- **Opening the Music Stage hijacked the whole browser into OS fullscreen on the first click.**
  Auto-fullscreen-on-first-gesture is a Blocks Studio behaviour (tablet-first); it applied to every
  immersive route, so the Music Stage triggered it too. The two concerns are now separate: immersive
  (nav hidden + page-scroll lock) still covers both studios, but OS fullscreen only arms on
  `/learn/blocks/` (user decision: "music is immersive, not fullscreen").

## 2026-07-14 (fix: opening the AI Studio no longer bounces onto an old song)

### Fixed
- **Clicking "✨ AI Studio" hijacked the kid onto `/learn/music/<old-session>`.** The Workspace
  auto-resumes the most recent session on entry, and the D-MS7 bridge (music session → Music
  Stage) fired on that AUTO-selected session too — so a kid whose latest session was a song could
  never reach the chat studio at all. Auto-select now skips music sessions (the Stage owns them);
  the bridge still redirects a music session the kid EXPLICITLY picks from the sessions list.

## 2026-07-13 (fix: the auth card fits above the fold on laptop screens)

### Fixed
- **The kid/parent login card's primary CTA sat below the fold on laptop-height screens.** The
  `hero-display` headline scales by viewport *width* (`7vw`), so a wide-but-short laptop window got
  a ~150px headline and pushed "Let me in" off-screen — which reads as a broken page, not a
  scrollable one (user-reported). `@media (max-height: 900px)` now compacts the shared auth shell
  (tighter shell/card padding, height-scaled headline, snugger field spacing), so the whole card
  fits at 1280×720 — asserted in the `kid-music-stage` journey's login step. Applies to every
  `auth-card` surface (kid login, class code, parent login/register/OTP).

## 2026-07-13 (fix: a banner above an immersive studio clipped its bottom bar off-screen)

### Fixed
- **The Music Stage's transport bar could sit below the fold whenever anything rendered above the
  studio.** `LearnLayout`'s immersive `<main>` was `h-full` — 100% of the whole layout column — and
  the stage itself was `h-dvh`, so the moment something occupied the strip above it (the
  `NudgeBanner`, which deliberately surfaces over studios so a teacher's nudge is never missed), the
  studio was pushed down and its bottom bar clipped by exactly the banner height. The immersive
  `<main>` is now `flex-1 min-h-0` (it gets the space actually left) and the Music Studio page fills
  it with `h-full` instead of assuming the full viewport — verified by inserting a synthetic banner
  and asserting the transport stays on screen. The Blocks Studio's own `height: 100dvh` has the same
  latent issue (tracked as a follow-up; not changed here while Story Blocks work is in flight).

## 2026-07-13 (feat: the Music Stage adopts the studio split layout — D-MS9)

### Changed
- **The Stage's page skeleton now mirrors the Creative Code Studio's split workspace.** Going
  fullscreen (D-MS7) had only moved the Stage out of the chat shell — inside, it was still one long
  vertical form (composer → stage → AI bubble → suggestion cards → timbre picker → lanes) that all
  scrolled, with the stage owning the most area yet usually off-screen. The page now **never
  scrolls**: the artefact (stage growing to fill its region + track lanes docked below it with
  internal scroll) owns the right panel, the tools (AI conversation, suggestion cards, timbre
  picker, ⚙️ Mixer) scroll internally in a left column with the composer **docked at its bottom**
  like the ChatPane's input, and the two panels are drag-resizable (`react-resizable-panels`, same
  library and feel as the Workspace split). The transport bar docks at the page bottom like the
  Taskbar — and now carries the **Airbotix brand mark + "Music Stage"**, since the immersive surface
  hides the nav that used to carry the logo. Below 740px the page falls back to the stacked column
  (fixed-height stage on top, composer leading the scroll, lanes behind the 🎚 drawer) so phones keep
  the old behaviour.

### Fixed
- **The transport bar could sit 8px below the viewport.** The pane root lacked `min-h-0`, so the
  docked composer's intrinsic height propagated up the flex chain (`min-height:auto`) and pushed the
  transport row partially out of the screen. The root chain is now `min-h-0` + `overflow-hidden`
  end-to-end, with a no-page-scroll assertion in the harness journey guarding it.

## 2026-07-13 (feat: the Music Stage gets its own fullscreen surface — D-MS7/D-MS8)

### Changed
- **Music is its own immersive surface (`/learn/music`), not a pane in the Workspace.** The Stage
  used to sit in the Workspace's three-pane chat shell: a session sidebar on the left, a chat
  transcript below, and the band — the entire point of the feature — squeezed into a 320px strip in
  between. Wrong shell. It now owns the viewport like the Blocks Studio: no nav bar, no page scroll,
  and the stage grows with the window. Sessions still back it (each take is a message pair), but the
  session rides the **URL** (`/learn/music/:sessionId`, so a reload returns to the same song) instead
  of a sidebar. The Workspace no longer offers music, and an old music session opened from the
  sessions list redirects to the Stage. Because an immersive surface has no nav bar, the stage now
  carries its own way out — a kid must never be trapped on it.
- **The empty stage says one thing, and you can see the band.** "Describe a song up top" appeared
  **four times** at once (neon marquee, hint box sub-line, AI bubble, transport row) around a stage
  whose instruments were dimmed into invisibility (opacity .32 + grayscale .8 + brightness .55,
  stacked on an already-dark stage). The band is the invitation — five silhouettes waiting to be
  filled — so it stays legible; the spotlight is what's off. The instruction now lives only where
  the kid is meant to act, and the AI bubble introduces what the conductor can *do* for them.

### Fixed
- **A "fullscreen" route could still be letterboxed.** `LearnLayout` hid the nav and locked page
  scroll for immersive routes, but the container width was decided by a *separate* list — so a route
  registered as immersive but missing from the fluid list rendered inside the centered `max-w-5xl`
  reading column. Immersive now implies full-bleed, with a test to keep it that way.
## 2026-07-13 (feat: Tiny Star Village A1 story mission)

### Added
- Connected the Story Blocks A1 mission guide, story coach, saved-program progress state, and completion celebration for Tiny Star Village.
- Enlarged the Lumilo character presentation in the story scene.
## 2026-07-13 (feat: Music Stage is the only music surface — Music Maker retired, D-MS6)

### Added
- **🎧 "Make it real" on the Music Stage.** The score the kid composed is now rendered as actual
  audio by the provider (ElevenLabs / Suno / the DeepRouter gateway) as step ⑥ of the Stage flow,
  3⭐. The prompt is **derived from the score on the stage** — title, genre, BPM, key, instruments,
  with the kid's own words carried as the topic — instead of asking them to describe the song a
  second time, which is how the retired Music Maker ended up handing back an MP3 that sounded
  nothing like what the kid had been listening to. Length comes from the last note's beat, not the
  note count (a dense bar and a sparse bar of the same width are the same number of seconds).
- **`?studio=` deep-link on the Workspace**, so the Create hub's 🎵 card lands straight on the
  Music Stage rather than the studio picker.

### Changed
- **Music Maker is retired; the Music Stage is the single music surface.** Two "make music" doors
  in the kid's navigation — one producing a real song it could not edit, one producing a score it
  could — was a split product, not two complementary tools. The Create hub's 🎵 card now opens the
  Stage, `MusicMakerPage.tsx` is deleted, and `/learn/create/music` redirects (old links, bookmarks
  and class rows still land somewhere). The real-audio capability is not lost — it moved into the
  Stage as step ⑥ above.
- **"Create for class" keeps working for music.** The Stage is session-based and owns no project,
  so the class id now rides the deep-link and is attached when 💾 Save / 🎧 Make-it-real mints the
  project — otherwise a song made for a class would have been invisible to the teacher.

### Fixed
- **A recorded song would have vanished on reload.** The backend only writes an audio Artifact when
  the request names a project (`runMedia`), and a free-play Stage session has none — so "Make it
  real" mints (and reuses) the song's project *before* generating. Save and Make-it-real share that
  one project, so a single song can't scatter across two My Works entries.

## 2026-07-13 (feat: favicon — airbotix-app had none)

### Added
- **Tab icon.** This SPA shipped with no favicon at all (browsers drew the blank default page
  glyph). Added `favicon-16/32.png` + `apple-touch-icon.png`: the brand cloud mark knocked out
  of a **brand-coral (AI Coding)** (`#FF7A66`) rounded square, generated from the real logo by
  `design-system/scripts/make-favicons.py` at the umbrella root, so the icons are reproducible
  rather than a one-off export nobody can rebuild.
  Two deliberate choices: the **wordmark is cropped out** (an illegible smear at 32px) and the
  tile is **filled**, not a transparent line-art logo (a black-on-transparent icon disappears
  against dark browser chrome). The 16px variant has its strokes dilated before the downscale —
  an outline mark's strokes fall below one pixel there and the robot's eyes vanish. Every
  surface (app / teacher / admin) gets the same mark in its own token colour, so staff running
  all three tabs can tell them apart at a glance.
- **`src/favicon.spec.ts`** — a favicon is a pure asset: drop the file or rename the link and
  nothing in the component tree fails, it just ships a blank tab. This spec is the only thing
  that would notice.

## 2026-07-13

### Removed
- **Creative Code Studio "welcome back" resume recap card.** The `ResumeRecap` card that
  greeted a kid on reopening a game in the playground AI chat is deleted: `ResumeRecap.tsx`
  + `ResumeRecap.test.tsx` removed; `panes/ChatPane.tsx` no longer renders it (its
  `recap`/`onContinueRecap` props dropped); `Workspace.tsx` drops the `resumeRecap` prop and
  the `recapDismissed`/`showRecap` state; `PlaygroundApp.tsx` drops the `resumeRecap` state
  and the best-effort `getProject → learning_context` recap fetch (the engine-load
  `getProject` call is unchanged); the `LearningContext` interface + both `learning_context`
  fields dropped from `pages/learn/code/codeApi.ts`. The backend `learning_context`
  persistence is unchanged (still agent-updated for continuity — playground-ai-prompt-prd
  D-PAP-19/22); only the kid-facing card is removed. See PRD v0.6.1 (S5 / D-PAP-18).

## 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Game overlay layer (D-GAME13, frontend runtime half).** `overlay.html` is the ONE
  reserved HTML fragment the game runtime renders: `buildGamePreview.ts` sanitizes it with
  DOMParser (scripts stripped, malformed markup repaired so an unclosed tag can't swallow
  kid scripts), inlines asset refs, and injects it as `<div id="overlay">` above `#game`
  with pass-through base CSS (`pointer-events:none` container; buttons/`[data-ui]` opt back
  in, ≥44px targets) BEFORE kid css. Every other `.html` file stays inert. A project
  without `overlay.html` builds a **byte-identical** srcdoc (pinned by unit snapshot).
  Overlay flows automatically to the public `/play` page, the class wall, and the teacher
  live view via the shared builder (`ReadOnlyGameFrame` share-path test).
- **Composited snapshots.** With an overlay present, the control channel's `snapshot`
  reply composites the engine canvas (drawn at its on-screen rect — letterbox reproduced)
  with the serialized `#overlay` DOM via an in-frame SVG foreignObject shim and posts
  `{ dataUrl, composited: true }`; ANY failure falls back to the raw canvas
  (`composited: false`). Workspace thumbnails pick this up with zero changes.
- **Screenshot evidence on the RunReport (D-HARN-21b, frontend half).** When the backend's
  verification payload carries `screenshot_requested` (turn result + `GET …/verify-state`),
  `useVerification` captures a frame snapshot over the control channel, downscales it to a
  ≤480px JPEG (`reportScreenshot.ts`), and attaches it to the RunReport POST as
  `screenshot: { dataUrl, width, height }`. ANY capture failure (timeout / decode /
  wire-illegal result) omits the field and still posts — a screenshot bug can never fail a
  kid's run. Covered in `useVerification.test.ts` + `reportScreenshot.test.ts`.
- **Starter overlay.** The starter scaffold ships an `overlay.html` (score chip + ▲/▼
  touch buttons) wired from `src/scenes/Game.js` (pointer held-flags + HUD score update);
  `game-smoke.spec.ts` proves it renders, passes events through, and its buttons work.
- **`mobile-play` Playwright project** (`devices['iPhone 14']`, scoped to the `@mobile`
  tests in `sharing-remix.spec.ts`): the /play overlay button taps on a phone viewport
  with no page scroll and no zoom; the desktop `chromium` project excludes `@mobile`.

### Changed
- **Public `/play` page fits the real mobile viewport:** `h-dvh` where supported with an
  `h-screen` fallback (`supports-[height:100dvh]:h-dvh` — the iOS/Android URL bar overlapped
  100vh and hid bottom-anchored touch controls; pre-dvh browsers keep a working full-height
  page); pull-to-refresh is disabled on the DOCUMENT root scroller via a route-scoped
  `overscroll-behavior-y: none` effect (an inner-div `overscroll-none` never intercepted the
  chained scroll); the gone/410 state likewise. Starter touch buttons stay live after any
  canvas touch (pointer-follow is now drag-gated — an ungated `activePointer` follow re-pinned
  the paddle to the stale touch position and deaded the ▲/▼ buttons), and `main.js` keeps the
  game on `var game` (console-pokeable + testable).
- `FileTree` shows a code-file icon for `.html`/`.htm`.
- `e2e/sharing-remix.spec.ts` frozen-snapshot fixture now carries `overlay.html`; the
  logged-out /play test asserts the overlay renders inside the play iframe while the
  brand bar stays a sibling ABOVE the surface (D-GAME10e reconciliation).

## 2026-07-12 (ci: self-host the Music Stage sample library — closes music-stage OQ-3)

### CI
- **`Publish soundfonts` workflow** (`workflow_dispatch`) mirrors the 11 GM programs
  the §5 style table uses (FluidR3_GM) and the 3 sampled drum machines to
  `s3://airbotix-app-prod/soundfonts/` — the SPA's own bucket + CloudFront, so
  samples are same-origin (no CORS, no new infra). Each upstream `dm.json` carries
  an **absolute** `baseUrl` back to its origin, so the workflow rewrites it to ours
  and fails if any upstream host survives — hosting the manifest alone would still
  have pulled samples off-site from a kid's browser.
- **`deploy.yml`**: sets `VITE_SOUNDFONT_BASE_URL=https://app.airbotix.ai/soundfonts`
  (turning the smplr timbre path ON in production — it stays closed without a
  self-hosted origin), and excludes `soundfonts/*` from the `--delete` sync so an
  app deploy can never wipe the sample library out from under the Stage.

## 2026-07-12 (feat: Music Stage — Save to My Works + Mixer entry + style_changes counter, music-stage-prd v0.5)

### Fixed
- **Version pin no longer yanked by passive updates** — a background messages
  refetch (or another device's activity) used to re-run the "new version
  arrived" choreography and unpin the kid's selected version (AC-7); the
  choreography now only fires for takes this client requested. Also added
  `data-testid="studio-pick-<id>"` to the studio picker buttons so harness
  journeys can target them deterministically.

### Added
- **`[💾 Save]` on the transport row (PRD §2 step ⑤)**: promotes the CURRENT
  score version into the kid's My Works by composing existing endpoints only —
  `POST /projects` (creative project titled after the song) → artifact
  `upload-url` → S3 PUT → register — with metadata mirroring the backend's own
  score persistence (inline `score`, summary fields, `upload_failed`
  resilience when the PUT fails). Saved state is per version; a failed save
  explains itself in the AI bubble and stays retryable
  (`saveScoreToMyWorks` in `musicScoreApi.ts`, `stage-save` testid).
- **`[⚙️ Mixer]` entry (PRD §4 D-MX1)**: toggles the legacy `MusicTrackList`
  mini-DAW region (real-audio tracks: imports + studio songs) as the Mixer
  home until the score Mixer (parent PRD §3.5–3.9) lands; the region states
  the capability boundary ("note editing / score re-rolls arrive soon") —
  never faked. Track-lane `⋯` menu entries now deep-link into the same region
  via `onOpenMixer` (`stage-mixer` / `mixer-region` / `mixer-note` testids).
- **`style_changes` audit counter (PRD §8)**: the Stage counts 0⭐
  instrument-style switches since the last generation and sends the tally on
  the next `POST /llm/music-score` (omitted when zero; backend audit defaults
  to 0), resetting after each success — the parent-visible iteration profile.

## 2026-07-12 (fix: Music Stage — production soundfont self-host gate, music-stage-prd OQ-3)

### Fixed
- **The smplr sample path is now gated on self-hosting in production
  (music-stage-prd OQ-3 launch gate)**: `smplrEnabled()` allows smplr only
  when `VITE_SOUNDFONT_BASE_URL` points at our own origin, or in DEV builds
  (external default sources are a dev convenience only). A production build
  without the env var closes the whole smplr path — no preloads, no loads, no
  external requests — and plays the styled Tone.js fallback voices (AC-11)
  with a single explanatory `console.info`.
- **`DrumMachine` always receives an explicit sample-source `url`**
  (`drumMachineUrlFor` → `<base>/drum-machines/<machine>/dm.json`, same origin
  as the soundfonts when self-hosted) instead of silently resolving smplr's
  baked-in third-party default.

### Changed
- `.env.example` documents `VITE_SOUNDFONT_BASE_URL` as REQUIRED in production
  for sampled timbres, including the expected layout (gleitz soundfonts at the
  root, smpldsnds drum machines under `/drum-machines`).

## 2026-07-12 (fix: Music Stage — align frontend↔backend music-score contract)

### Fixed
- **Suggestion-card modifier keys now use the canonical backend enum**
  (`energy+1` / `energy-1` / `drums+` / `guitar_solo` / `surprise`, matching
  platform-backend `SCORE_MODIFIER_KEYS`): the DTO enum-validates the
  `modifier` field, so the previous `energy_up` / `energy_down` / `big_drums`
  keys would have 400'd every suggestion card. `stageData.test.ts` now pins
  the canonical keys as a cross-repo contract test.
- **Version history works in free-play sessions (no project → no Artifact)**:
  the backend inlines the composed score on the session message itself
  (`Message.metadata.score`, music-stage-prd §3.5), so
  `aggregateScoreVersions` now reads message metadata first and falls back to
  the artifact's inlined copy for project-scoped generations. Previously
  free-play generations produced an empty version rail.

### Changed
- `MusicScoreResult` matches the real `POST /llm/music-score` response shape:
  gains the inline `score` and `session_id` fields alongside `stars_charged` /
  `balance_after` / `artifact_id`.
- `Message` (WorkspacePage) gains the optional `metadata?: { score? }` field
  carried by score-bearing session messages.

## 2026-07-12 (feat: Music Stage — smplr timbres + instrument styles, music-stage-prd Phase D §5/§6.1)

### Added
- **smplr GM-soundfont timbre engine (PRD §6.1, Tier-1)**: every §5 instrument
  style now maps to a real sampled voice — melodic styles to General MIDI
  programs (new `soundfont.ts` with the 12-program `GM_PROGRAM_SOUNDFONTS`
  table), drum styles to sampled drum machines (`DRUM_MACHINE_FOR_STYLE`:
  Rock→LM-2, Lo-fi→Casio-RZ1, Electro→TR-808) with fuzzy hit-name → sample
  mapping. Soundfonts lazy-load per program with an 8s timeout; the base URL is
  a named constant overridable via `VITE_SOUNDFONT_BASE_URL` (defaults to
  smplr's official source; switches to our S3+CloudFront before launch, OQ-3).
- **Styled Tone.js fallbacks (§5 fallback column, AC-11)**: new
  `toneFallbackVoices.ts` implements one synth recipe per style (square +
  wave-shaper crunch, −12st sine Deep Sub, +12st Music Box bell, tremolo organ,
  detuned-saw Cloud Pad, membrane+noise drum kits with a low-passed Lo-fi
  flavor…). New per-track `voices.ts` controller starts on the fallback
  instantly and upgrades to smplr **in place** — a failed/slow soundfont load
  degrades with a console warning and playback never interrupts.
- **1-beat style audition (§5)**: picking a non-None style while idle plays a
  single representative beat with the new timbre (`previewStyle` on the
  playback hook) — 0⭐, no regeneration; stage style tag and lane style name
  stay in sync (AC-5).
- **Soundfont preloading (§6.1)**: the composing animation now doubles as a
  cache warm-up — `preloadPrograms` fetches the GM programs of the pending
  style set (genre preset on first generation) while the LLM writes the score.
- Unit tests: style→GM mapping completeness (15 styles + None per slot), URL
  building/env override, load/timeout/degrade paths, drum-hit fuzzy mapping,
  fallback recipe selection + transposes, voice-controller upgrade/dispose
  races, and pane tests for preview-on-pick, no-preview-on-None and preload.

### Changed
- `useScorePlayback` now builds voices per slot **style** (not a fixed synth
  per instrument) behind stable controllers, so style changes swap timbres
  mid-playback without touching the Tone.js Transport scheduling (architecture
  unchanged per §6.1: smplr replaces the sound source, not the scheduler).

## 2026-07-12 (feat: Music Stage — Track Lanes, music-stage-prd Phase C §4)

### Added
- **Track Lanes polish (PRD §4)**: piano-roll note blocks now **light up while
  they sound** (full-strength instrument color + glow, synced with the
  playhead and the stage pulses); each lane gained a tail `⋯` overflow menu
  that keeps per-track download / note editing / re-roll **off the kid-facing
  lane** and deep-links them into the advanced Mixer via a new
  `onOpenMixer(trackIndex, action)` contract — entries render greyed out with
  a one-line note until the Mixer task wires it (stated capability boundaries,
  never faked).
- Component tests for the lanes: one lane per generated track including extra
  tracks (percussion/strings, AC-9), lane-click ↔ stage-slot selection for
  nearest-instrument mapping, mute/solo dimming the stage in sync (AC-6
  frontend half), VOL forwarding, active-note lighting, overflow-menu
  behaviour, and the narrow-screen drawer handle (AC-12).

### Changed
- Compacted the Track Lanes styling (narrower channel strip, shorter
  piano-rolls) so Stage + Lanes share one desktop screen per PRD §2.1.

## 2026-07-12 (feat: Music Stage — studio=music opening, music-stage-prd Phase B)

### Added
- **Music Stage** now opens `/learn/workspace` studio=music (replacing the
  form-based setup, music-stage-prd.md §1.1): a theater `StageView` with 5
  fixed instrument positions, moving spotlight, genre neon marquee,
  note-triggered performance pulses, 16-step walk lights, empty-band state and
  staggered first-entrance pop-in (all animation disabled under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`); a `ComposerBar` (description input, 6 inspiration
  chips, 4 genre pills, `−3⭐` compose button, Stars chip); a full-stage
  composing overlay for the real LLM wait (first-take vs remix subtitles, no
  fake progress bar); a template-assembled **AI bubble** (title/key/BPM/genre +
  what changed — no extra LLM call); **5 suggestion cards** that iterate via
  the same `POST /llm/music-score` endpoint with a structured `modifier` key +
  `existingScore` (`🎲 Surprise me` re-rolls without `existingScore`); and
  client-side **version pills** aggregated from session messages (0⭐ switch
  that preserves manual instrument styles and mute — AC-7).
- **0⭐ instrument-style layer (UI/state)**: 3 styles + None per stage
  instrument with genre presets applied after the first generation; `None`
  silences the mapped tracks and dims the instrument on stage. GM-program
  mapping is declared for the upcoming smplr timbre task (PRD §5/§6.1).
- Component/unit tests for the Stage: empty stage (AC-1), Stars guard that
  sends no request under 3⭐ (AC-8), composing overlay + request contract
  (AC-2/3/4), kid-friendly failure + retry (AC-10 path), lanes-per-track
  rendering (AC-9 frontend half) and version switching (AC-7).

### Changed
- Extracted the Tone.js engine from `MusicScorePlayer` into a shared
  `useScorePlayback` hook (instrument-keyed mute/solo/volume, velocity
  support, all 14 score instrument kinds, note-pulse subscription) and
  re-homed the per-track channel strips as `TrackLanes` under the stage —
  one transport drives the stage pulses, walk lights and lanes. On narrow
  screens (<740px) the lanes collapse behind a persistent `🎚 Tracks` handle
  (AC-12). `MusicScorePlayer.tsx` was removed; score types now live in
  `stage/scoreTypes.ts` with lane colors on K-12 brand tokens.
- `studios.ts`: the music studio no longer has a setup form (Stage replaces
  it); music sessions skip straight from the picker into the Stage.

## 2026-07-11

### Changed
- Updated repository instructions and demo documentation to use **Story
  Blocks** and **Creative Code Studio**, while preserving stable technical
  identifiers and `/try/*` routes.

### Added

- Added the first playable Tiny Star Village curriculum slice (`A1-H`) to Story Blocks, including a first-party Little Light SVG character, a dim window-room scene, and safe local image-character rendering with emoji fallback.
- Added a persistent **Story Blocks** launcher to the `/learn/workspace` sidebar, routing directly to the Story Blocks starter/library page without pretending block coding is an AI chat session.
- Completed the A1-H learning loop with an automatic story-and-mission introduction, a post-run observation check, retry guidance, an explicit success explanation, and a persistent **Story mission** launcher. Curriculum projects now carry a safe `lessonId` instead of relying on their display name; existing A1-H projects are recognised by their exact scene/asset/block fingerprint.
- Reworked the A1-H storybook against the season SOT into four narrative beats: the Bell Tower's warm morning light, the missing bell and light, Little Light's dream-mixed greeting, and the child's invitation as Morning Light Helper. Added character dialogue and a real story synopsis to the starter card instead of showing an operation instruction as its description.
- Added a persistent Little Light story coach beside the A1-H stage. It keeps the next action visible after the storybook closes, narrates the live Say-then-Hop execution as the blocks run, offers direct Go/retry actions, and shows the successful `Morning → Hop` block-to-story proof with a left-to-right explanation.

## 2026-07-10 (feat: registration legal-consent checkbox)

### Added
- **Required legal-consent checkbox on `RegisterPage`.** Family setup is now
  blocked until the parent ticks "I am the parent or legal guardian … and I
  agree to the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Parental Consent" (each
  linked to airbotix.ai, opening in a new tab); the form sends
  `accept_terms: true` to `POST /families`, which the backend also enforces and
  records (`terms_accepted_at` + `terms_version`). Replaces the previous
  passive "by continuing you agree…" footnote. Covered in
  `RegisterPage.test.tsx` (blocked submit without consent + consent flag in the
  POST body).

## 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Playground chat: ANSWER chips on question turns (D-HARN-07 FE half,
  `playground-agent-harness-prd.md`).** A settled turn with ZERO `changes` and non-empty
  `next_steps` is a QUESTION turn — the summary is a clarifying question and the chips are its
  answer options: the chip row leads with "Pick one:" (instead of "What next?") and tapping a
  chip sends its prompt with `guided:false` (guided:true selects the guided-chip prompt goal
  server-side and re-offers chips — wrong framing for an answer). Chips on turns WITH changes
  keep `guided:true` exactly as before; seed bubbles carrying `actions` (launch hand-off /
  first-turn replay) stay in the D-PAP-26 guided loop. Testid stays `next-step` either way.
  Predicate lives in `AIChatPanel.tsx` `ChatRow` (`isQuestionTurn`). Covered in
  `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`.
- **Playground console: real fix-turn evidence (D-HARN-11a FE half).** The sandbox console
  shim (`CONSOLE_CAPTURE` in `learn/code/buildPreview.ts`, shared by the code-studio preview
  and the game srcdoc) now relays the Error object's stack — clipped to `STACK_CLIP_CHARS`
  (1,000) inside the sandbox — for uncaught window errors and Error-object `console.error`
  args, as a new optional `stack` field on `ConsoleLine`. `GameFrame` threads stacks into the
  visible console lines ONLY — the RunReport collector feed stays stack-free (its wire shape
  is schema-capped + backend-mirrored). "Ask AI to fix" (`fixPrompt`, now taking the console
  lines) builds: the newest error with its file:line under the STABLE `My game has an error`
  prefix (the backend keys previous-fix context injection on it; drift-alarmed against the
  demo matcher), then up to 3 older DISTINCT error lines with locations, then the newest
  error's stack in a fenced block, ending with `Can you fix it?` — total clipped to 3,000
  chars (backend prompt cap is 8,000). Covered in `buildPreview.consoleCapture.test.ts`,
  `GameRunnerPane.test.tsx`, `scriptedAgent.test.ts` (drift alarm).
- **Playground chat: kid-safe turn-failure taxonomy + idempotent retry (D-HARN-02,
  `playground-agent-harness-prd.md`).** `AI_UNAVAILABLE` turn failures (the backend's new 502
  envelope for upstream/loop errors) render FE-owned kid copy — "The AI helper had a hiccup
  and couldn't finish that — let's try again!" — on a retryable bubble with a "Try again ↻"
  chip (`chat-retry-chip`). `useGameAgent` mints ONE idempotency key per logical turn and
  threads it through `deps.runTurn` → `codeApi.runAgentTurn`. **Each retryable bubble carries
  its OWN replay payload** (`retry: {prompt, turnKey, guided}` → `retryTurn`), so a stale chip
  replays ITS turn — never a later one — always with the SAME key (the backend replays instead
  of double-charging); the error-banner `chat-retry` (`retryLast`) also reuses the last turn's
  key. New `panes/useTurnHygiene.ts` owns the key/queue/watchdog state; `panes/chatChips.tsx`
  owns the pill + chip UI. Covered in `useGameAgent.test.ts`, `useTurnHygiene.test.ts`,
  `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`.
- **Playground chat: no silent input drops — busy queue + silent-turn watchdog (D-HARN-03).**
  `send()` while a turn is busy queues exactly ONE next message — shown as the composer's
  "I'll do this next: …" pill (`chat-queued-pill`, ✕ = `chat-queued-cancel` → `cancelQueued`)
  — and auto-sends it when the turn settles; further sends while one is queued are ignored
  (the composer keeps the draft). Next-step chips and the Game Runner's "Ask AI to fix"
  (`ask-ai-fix`, new `busy` prop threaded from `Workspace`) render disabled during a turn.
  A 180 s watchdog (`TURN_WATCHDOG_MS`, re-armed on every stream delta; test override
  `turnWatchdogMs`) aborts a silent turn through the existing clean-cancel path (0 Stars) and
  settles the bubble into calm "That took too long — let's try again!" copy with the retry
  chip. The watchdog also guards the OTHER long paid awaits: the engine-switch rebuild,
  plan-approve (`approveTurn` now takes an `AbortSignal`), and the acknowledged-warn turn.
  The offline pre-check now posts the kid bubble + a retryable offline bubble instead of
  silently eating the message (which the queue's auto-send could otherwise hit). Covered in
  `useGameAgent.test.ts`, `useTurnHygiene.test.ts`, `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`,
  `GameRunnerPane.test.tsx`.

### Changed
- **Playground pre-turn flush must now SUCCEED for every FRESH paid turn (D-HARN-05).**
  `flushBeforeTurn` reports success; when the pre-turn save of the kid's freshest edits
  fails, the PAID turn does NOT run against a stale VFS — the pending bubble settles into
  "Let me save your changes first — try again in a moment." with the retry chip, and retry
  re-attempts the flush + turn. The gate sits immediately before the paid POST (the free,
  non-metered classify may run first), so a turn stopped mid-classify never writes the VFS —
  a clean cancel must not bump `vfs_version` (harness `kid-game-stop-turn`). The gate covers
  `send()`, the agency confirm in `confirmPending`, and the acknowledged-warn turn in
  `confirmWarn`; the ONE exception is plan-APPROVE, which stays best-effort because the
  staged plan already ran against the VFS flushed when it was sent. Covered in
  `useGameAgent.test.ts`.
- **All teacher prep creation now happens in the app** (`/teacher/prep/new?class=…&kind=…`),
  not in teacher-console — so it runs against the app tab's freshly-refreshed teacher
  session and can't be killed by the cross-tab refresh-cookie rotation that was closing
  the Blocks/Web Code tab. `TeacherPrepStudioPage` handles the `new` route: game →
  prompt-first `PlaygroundApp`; blocks/code → `NewPrepStudio` creates the prep project
  once (`POST /classes/:id/prep-projects` via new `teacherPrepApi`) then mounts the real
  studio on the seeded VFS. Covered by `TeacherPrepStudioPage.test.tsx`.
- **Teacher prep Game Playground is now PROMPT-FIRST — parity with the kid flow.**
  A teacher opening a new game prep lands on the SAME prompt screen a kid sees
  (`/teacher/prep/new?class=<id>`); the prep project is created only when they submit
  the first prompt (`PlaygroundApp` gains a `prepClassId` prop that, for a NEW game,
  creates a teacher-owned prep game via `POST /classes/:id/prep-projects` and rewrites
  the URL to `/teacher/prep/:id` — the kid create/placement path is untouched).
  `createPrepGameProject` added to `playgroundApi`. Covered by
  `PlaygroundApp.classCreate.test.tsx` + `TeacherPrepStudioPage.test.tsx`.

### Fixed
- **Teacher prep studios no longer strand a teacher on a load error.** When a prep
  studio is hosted embedded and the project fails to load, the Blocks error-state
  "← Back to Blocks" link and the game studio's load-error "Make something new" button
  used to navigate into `/learn/*`, which bounces a `user` (teacher) principal to
  `/portal`. Both are now suppressed when `embedded` (the prep banner carries the only
  Back): `BlocksStudioPage` gates the error link on `readOnly || embedded`, and
  `PlaygroundApp` gains an `embedded` prop that drops the load-error `onBack` (the button
  hides). Kid/default behaviour is unchanged. Covered by new cases in
  `BlocksStudioPage.test.tsx` and `PlaygroundApp.embedded.test.tsx`.

## 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Teacher prep-project studio (editable) — Stage 2.** A new `/teacher/prep/:projectId`
  route (`TeacherPrepStudioPage`, under the `/teacher` `ProtectedRoute kind="user"` outlet)
  mounts the REAL studios EDITABLE so a teacher builds/iterates a prep project exactly like
  a kid does — `PlaygroundApp` (game), `CodeStudioPage` (code), `BlocksStudioPage` (blocks) —
  by project `kind`. It fetches `GET /projects/:id` (the backend authorizes the owning teacher
  to read+write + run 0-Star AI turns; a 403/404 shows a friendly owner-scope error), carries
  a slim "Teacher prep · editable" banner (distinct from the read-only live viewer's dark
  "Live · Read-only" banner) whose Back closes the tab (deep-linked from teacher-console in
  Stage 3). Covered by `TeacherPrepStudioPage.test.tsx`.
- **Studio `embedded` home-link seam.** `CodeStudioPage` and `BlocksStudioPage` accept an
  `embedded` prop that hides the studio's own page-level Home/back navigation (which points
  into `/learn/*` and would bounce a `user` principal) while keeping the editor fully editable
  — reusing the existing `EmbeddedCodeStudio` `embedded` semantics. The teacher prep studio
  uses it so its banner carries the only Back; `PlaygroundApp` needs no prop (it has no
  in-studio home link — its home is the Learn nav, not mounted here). Kid/readOnly behaviour is
  unchanged. Covered by `CodeStudioPage.readOnly.test.tsx` + `BlocksStudioPage.test.tsx`.
- **Playground: "Stop waiting" while the AI is thinking (D-PAP-48).** During the WorkingCard
  "busy" phase (before the reply streams), the chat composer shows a Stop button
  (`chat-stop-waiting`). Tapping it aborts the in-flight `classify` + `runTurn` fetch via an
  `AbortController`; the backend treats the client disconnect as a clean cancel (no Stars). The
  pending agent bubble becomes a calm "your game is unchanged" message (no error styling) and the
  composer re-enables. Distinct from the existing streaming Stop (`chat-stop`), which only skips
  the typing animation. An in-flight turn is also aborted if the workspace unmounts mid-turn.
  Covered by `AIChatPanel.test.tsx` (three-way composer button) and `useGameAgent.test.ts`
  (cancelTurn settles the turn calmly, no Stars, both fetches receive the signal).

### Fixed
- **Class assets with spaces in their filename now load in the game (Model A).** The
  game-runtime class-asset resolver's `assets/class/<name>` regex stopped at the first
  whitespace, so a model like `Animated Platformer Character.glb` captured only
  `Animated`, never matched the shared library, and was never inlined — the sandboxed
  game then fetched the bare path against its opaque origin and failed with
  `3D model failed to load … — Failed to fetch`. The resolver now uses the same
  quote-anchored match as the srcdoc inliner (`buildGamePreview.inlineAssetRefs`),
  capturing the full filename (spaces included) up to the closing quote. Regression
  tests in `classAssetResolver.test.ts`.
- **Game studio: pause & mute now actually stop the background music.** The engine control shims
  only froze the game LOOP (`loop.sleep()` / `cancelAnimationFrame`), but Web Audio runs on the
  AudioContext hardware clock — so looping BGM kept playing through a "pause", and three.js games
  (which rarely wire the optional `setMuted`) ignored "mute" entirely. A new engine-agnostic
  `AUDIO_CONTROL` shim in `buildGamePreview.ts` patches the `AudioContext` constructor (before any
  engine boots) to track every context and route it through a master gain, then reacts to the
  control messages — `pause`→`suspend()` + pause playing media, `mute`→gain 0 + `media.muted`. Works
  for Phaser WebAudio, three.js `AudioListener`, and raw `<audio>`/`AudioContext` alike. Covered by
  `buildGamePreview.audioControl.test.ts` (executes the shim against a mocked AudioContext + media
  element) and structural assertions in `buildGamePreview.test.ts`.
- **My Works can now delete class projects directly.** Class work and on-wall cards expose the
  same Delete action as personal cards, so kids no longer have to move a class project to
  Personal before deleting it. Covered by `WorkCard.test.tsx` and `ProjectsListPage.test.tsx`.
- **Find a class: "All cities" is now selectable (B3).** `readStoredCity()` returns
  `null` when the parent has made no choice (distinct from an explicit "All cities"),
  and the Family.city default now seeds the city select only on first visit — an
  explicit choice (including "All cities") is never overridden by a later
  `families` refetch. A Gold Coast parent can browse other cities and stay there.
- **Find a class: Online filter wiring.** Selecting "Online" now queries
  `?online=true` (was `?city=Online`) and is never written to `Family.city` or PATCHed
  to the family profile.
- **Distinct error states.** `MyClassesPanel` and `FindClassesPage` now show a
  dedicated error card with a retry action when their query fails, instead of the
  "No bookings yet." / "No open seats" empty state — a transient 500 no longer tells a
  paid parent they have nothing booked.
- **My Classes: no phantom reserve card (B2, frontend half).** Backend excludes
  pay-now class-seat leads from `booking_requests`; the panel is covered by a spec
  asserting a bucket of only enrollments + pending orders renders exactly one card per
  purchase (no duplicate "we'll contact you" card).

### Changed
- **Game Studio: class assets are now DIRECTLY referable — no "Add to my game" button
  (class-shared-assets-prd Model A).** A class shared asset is used straight from the chat
  by its virtual path `assets/class/<name>` — the AI and the runtime resolve it from the
  shared class library, with NO copy into the kid's project VFS. Removed the "Add to my game"
  copy affordance (`ClassAssets`/`AssetViewerPane`); the Class tab is now browse + copy-reference.
  - New `classAssetResolver` (`useReferencedClassAssets`) resolves only the class assets a game
    references to inline-ready `data:` URLs; `buildGamePreview` accepts `virtualAssets` and
    inlines them exactly like a VFS asset, threaded through `GameFrame`/`GameRunnerPane` (passed
    live so a class asset resolving re-runs once without restarting on code edits).
  - Persisted copies now happen only when a game is SHARED — the backend bakes referenced class
    assets into the frozen public `/play/:shareId` snapshot (platform-backend).
  - Also: `useGameAgent` flushes the debounced save before every turn (`flushSave`), so the agent
    always reads the kid's latest files (not just class assets — any in-flight edit).
  - Covered by `classAssetResolver.test.ts`, `buildGamePreview.test.ts` (virtual inline),
    `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx` (reference, no copy button), and `useGameAgent.test.ts`
    (flush-before-turn ordering + best-effort on save failure).
- **Playground AI chat image attachments are temporarily disabled.** The workspace no longer wires the
  chat-image upload seam into the composer, hiding the picture button/input while leaving the backend
  upload and moderation path intact for a controlled re-enable. Covered by `PlaygroundApp.readOnly.test.tsx`.
- **Shared AUD formatter.** New `src/lib/money.ts` `formatAud(cents)` renders whole
  dollars as `A$39` and cents as `A$39.50` (was `A$39.5`). Replaces the three local
  `aud()` helpers in `FindClassesPage`, `ClassCheckoutPage`, and `TutoringPage`.

## 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Portal class discovery (`portal-class-discovery-prd.md` v0.3).** `/portal`
  now defaults to Find a class, with `/portal/dashboard` preserving the old dashboard.
  Parents can filter upcoming purchasable classes by city, persist their city to the
  family profile, jump straight to class-seat checkout, and see a My Classes panel for
  locked enrollments, pending payments, and reserve requests. The same My Classes panel
  is also shown at the top of Courses.
- **Pay-now class seat checkout** (`class-seat-checkout-prd.md` D-CSC-8): new
  `/portal/checkout/class/:classId` route + `ClassCheckoutPage` — class summary
  (name, date, venue, whole-course price from `GET /class-seats/classes/:classId`),
  pick-an-existing-kid or new-kid (nickname + age) step, Pay button that POSTs
  `/class-seats/checkout` and hands off to the Airwallex hosted page, and a
  return-trip poll of `GET /class-seats/orders/:id` that renders "Seat locked",
  payment-failed retry (only `failed` re-offers Pay, after clearing the stored
  intent), or a paid-but-full refund notice. Poll timeout shows a dedicated
  screen that hides the Pay button (double-charge guard) with a "Check again"
  that resumes polling the same stored intent plus a contact-support hint.
  Parents without a family are bounced to `/portal/register` first (D-CSC-3).
  Covered by `ClassCheckoutPage.test.tsx`.
- **Portal Courses dual CTA** (D-CSC-1): each course card gains a lazy
  "See class times" toggle (`GET /courses/:slug/classes`) listing purchasable
  classes with date / venue / price and a "Pay now & lock a seat" link to the
  checkout route. The existing "Request a seat" reserve flow is unchanged.
  Covered by `CoursesPage.test.tsx`.

### Changed
- **OTP return-to now survives new-user registration**: `VerifyOtpPage` threads
  the stashed `from` location through to `/portal/register` as router state, and
  `RegisterPage` sends the parent back to `from` (e.g. a marketing pay-now
  deep-link) after the family is created — dashboard default unchanged when no
  `from`. The has-family redirect only fires for parents who *arrive* with a
  family (and now honours `from` too); the mid-creation `me` refetch no longer
  hijacks the family-code success screen. Covered by `VerifyOtpPage.test.tsx`
  and `RegisterPage.test.tsx`.

### Fixed
- **My Classes course covers now use a larger left media panel on the class hub.**
  `ClassHeader` keeps the existing class title / CTA / progress layout but moves it to the right
  of a near-square course image, matching portrait-ish course artwork better than the old narrow
  top strip. `ClassCoverImage` renders images as an absolute `inset-0 object-cover` layer so the
  media panel has no gutters. Covered by `ClassCoverImage.test.tsx` and `ClassHubPage.test.tsx`.

### Changed
- **In-class Create now respects the course's enabled project types (my-classes D-MC-11).**
  `ClassMineSummary.allowed_kinds` feeds `CreateForClassSheet`; top-level creative/blocks tools
  and Code Studio's Web Code/Game Playground subtypes are filtered separately. Personal
  `/learn/create` remains unchanged.

- **Class Create → Code Studio → Game Playground now lands on the initial prompt screen.**
  The class sheet no longer pre-creates a blank `phaser_blank` game and opens `/learn/playground/:id`.
  It routes to `/learn/playground/new?class=<classId>` so the kid enters the first game prompt;
  `PlaygroundApp` then creates the real game from that prompt and attaches it to the class via
  `PATCH /projects/:id/placement` before generation starts. Covered by `CreateForClassSheet.test.tsx`,
  `PlaygroundApp.classCreate.test.tsx`, and `playgroundApi.test.ts`.

## 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **Playground Class asset tab reaches full parity with My-assets — renders `model` (glb 3D), `other` (data/fonts/shaders) + sprite sheets.**
  The backend asset libraries were widened to the playground's full importable set, so `GET /projects/:id/class-assets`
  can now include `kind: 'model' | 'other'` (a sprite arrives as an `image` PLUS a sibling `<name>.anim.json` `other`
  item). `ClassAssetView.kind` widens to `'image'|'audio'|'video'|'model'|'other'`. The Class grid now HIDES `.anim.json`
  sidecar cards, labels an image-with-sidecar as a "sprite sheet", renders `model` via the same lazy `modelThumbnail`
  three renderer My-assets uses (3D-cube icon fallback while it loads / on failure), and gives `other` a `File` icon;
  `KIND_ICON` gains `model`/`other`. The detail view renders a glb through the same lazy `ModelPreview` three stage
  (never crashes for glb) and `other` as a file icon + name + size. "Add to my game" copies bytes into
  `assets/class/<name>` for EVERY kind (a glb copies like an image, loaded from the VFS via THREE.GLTFLoader); for a
  sprite it ALSO fetches + copies the sibling `.anim.json` sidecar to `assets/class/<name>.anim.json` (from the sidecar
  item's own signed URL) so the sprite animates exactly like a My-assets sprite. Covered by
  `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx` (model/other render, sidecar hidden + "sprite sheet" label, model detail no
  crash, sprite add copies BOTH files) and `playgroundApi.test.ts` (widened kinds pass through).
- **Playground Class asset tab now shows merged course-pack defaults + class assets, labelled by origin (D-CSA-3).**
  `GET /projects/:id/class-assets` now returns one flat list that merges the bound course pack's
  admin-curated DEFAULTS (`source:'course'`, first — no `class_id`) with the class's own teacher
  assets (`source:'class'`). `ClassAssetView` gains a required `source: 'class' | 'course'` and
  makes `class_id` optional. The Asset Viewer's Class tab labels each grid card with a tiny origin
  badge (`data-testid="class-asset-source"` → "Course" / "Class") and the detail "Source" row now
  reflects the origin ("Course library (set by Airbotix)" vs "Class library (from your teacher)").
  The "Add to my game" copy-into-VFS flow is unchanged (the merge is transparent to it); the
  existing `class.asset_added/removed/assets_copied` WS refetch already covers course-default
  changes (backend fans the same events out). Covered by `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`
  (course-first ordering, per-card origin badges, detail source labels) and `playgroundApi.test.ts`.
### Fixed
- **A shared 3D game rendered NOTHING; a shared 2D game was fine (D-3D-01).** The read-only play
  surface — `ReadOnlyGameFrame`, used by the public play host (`/play/:shareId`) AND the class wall
  (`WallGameCard`) — always built its sandbox srcdoc with the default Phaser (2D) engine, so a
  three.js (3D) game loaded the wrong engine global and silently failed to render. `ReadOnlyGameFrame`
  now takes an `engine` prop and passes it to `buildGameSrcDoc`; `readPublicSnapshot` returns
  `{ files, engine }` (the new `PublicSnapshot`) from the backend's engine-carrying public payload
  (null/missing ⇒ `phaser`, back-compat); `PublicPlayPage` + `WallGameCard` thread it through. Covered
  by `ReadOnlyGameFrame.test.tsx` (three vs phaser vendor + strict sandbox), `PublicPlayPage.test.tsx`
  (a 3D share builds three.js), and `demoAdapters.test.ts` (demo snapshots are 2D `phaser`).

## 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- **Playground/code chat: a safety-screen OUTAGE no longer blames the kid's picture (D-PAP-46).**
  The backend now distinguishes a classifier outage (`422 MODERATION_UNAVAILABLE`) from a real
  content reject. `useGameAgent` maps it to the new `IMAGE_CHECK_HICCUP_MESSAGE` ("Our picture
  checker had a hiccup — nothing wrong with your picture! Try again in a moment. 🛠️") and — unlike
  a real reject (which clears via `imageRejectNonce`) — hands the unjudged, already-uploaded refs
  back through the new `imageRestore` nonce: `AIChatPanel` RE-STAGES them `ready` (submit had
  cleared the composer), so one tap retries with no re-upload (text-only turns get a generic
  "safety check had a hiccup" line; `useCodeStudio` maps the code too). Covered by
  `useGameAgent.test.ts` (hiccup copy, reject nonce untouched, `imageRestore` carries the refs,
  0 Stars) and `AIChatPanel.test.tsx` (restore re-stages `ready` + resend carries the same S3 ref).

## 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Stale-verdict guard + frame-source check (adversarial review findings).** (1) A run-report
  POST is held open for the whole server-side fix turn; if the kid sent a chat turn meanwhile,
  the late `fixing` verdict used to apply the fix turn's OLDER files over the kid's newer turn
  and hijack the armed chain — `useVerification` now discards any verdict whose chain is no
  longer armed. (2) `GameFrame` ignores messages from any window other than its own iframe
  (cross-frame report pollution guard; sourceless synthetic events — jsdom — still pass).
- **Verification restarts now guarantee a live GameFrame (D-PAP-40).** In the default Window
  layout the Game window launches CLOSED (chat-first), and a closed/minimized window mounts no
  `GameFrame` — so the verification loop's restart (resume-verify on workspace mount, i.e. the
  initial build's auto-run) observed nothing and no RunReport ever posted: the first turn's
  `verify_status` stayed `pending` forever. `useVerification`'s `restartGame` now goes through
  `ensureGameRunnerVisible()` (new `playgroundStore` helper): it opens the Game window only when
  it is NOT on screen, and no-ops in split mode and on an already-visible window — so a silent
  fix beat still never yanks the window forward. The open is deliberately **without raising**
  (never `openOrFocus`): the default game rect overlaps the chat's right edge, and raising it
  sat the game stage OVER the chat's send button — the kid literally couldn't click Send
  (caught by the harness's chat-send-clicking journeys: `safeguarding`, `sharing-remix`,
  `teacher-kid-classroom`). The seeded z-order keeps the chat on top where they overlap.

### Added
- **Playground post-apply verification loop — FE half (playground-ai-prompt-prd D-PAP-40/41/44).**
  After an applied game turn (`verification: 'pending'` on the turn result), the studio now runs
  the game **instrumented**, builds a structured **RunReport** (v1, mirrored from
  `platform-backend/src/code-sessions/run-report.ts`), and POSTs it to
  `…/code/turn/:turnId/run-report`; the **server adjudicates**. Product behaviour is locked:
  verification is **SILENT on success and on auto-fix** — a `fixing` verdict applies the fix
  turn's files quietly (same files+version funnel as chat turns), restarts the game, and reports
  `attempt+1`; only the **co-debug** hand-off surfaces (one warm bubble carrying the server's
  message). Resume-verify: on workspace mount, `GET …/code/verify-state` picks up a still-pending
  turn (closed tab) and re-runs at `attempts+1`. Pieces:
  - `buildGamePreview.ts`: both control shims' `__airbotixStat` now carries the **engine's
    cumulative `frames`** counter (Phaser `loop.frame` / three `renderer.info.render.frame` —
    never rAF, which ticks while frozen); a new engine-agnostic **RUN_PROBE** answers
    `{action:'report'}` with an 8×8 canvas sample (`{__airbotixRunReport, canvas}` — any probe
    failure degrades, never breaks the game); a three-only **THREE_LOADER_GUARD** wraps
    `GLTFLoader`/`TextureLoader.load` to post `{__airbotixAsset, url, len, ok, error?}` and
    `console.error('[airbotix] …')` BEFORE the app's own onError can swallow the failure;
    `buildGamePreview()` returns an **assetManifest** (data:-URL prefix+length per inlined asset)
    so a reported data: URL maps back to the kid's path. Phaser srcdoc unchanged beyond
    `frames` + RUN_PROBE; scriptRanges (kid file:line resolution) regression-tested with the new
    parts.
  - NEW `runReport.ts`: the FE RunReport mirror + pure `createRunCollector` (console
    classification incl. rejection/window-error routing, caps 6/4/3/3×300 chars with transparent
    `dropped` counts, de-dupe, asset-outcome mapping — raw un-inlined paths → `missing-ref`).
    Curated failure **warns are PROMOTED to `consoleErrors`** (Phaser reports missing
    textures/scenes via `console.warn`, and the backend's clean-run predicate treats warns as
    advisory — a broken game must not verify clean).
  - `GameFrame.tsx`: optional `onRunReport`/`reportAttempt` — per run it feeds the collector,
    asks the probe after a 4 s observation window, and emits the finalized report exactly once
    (probe silent ≥1.5 s → `probeError: 'no-response'`).
  - NEW `panes/useVerification.ts`: the loop driver (arm per applied turn, post per attempt,
    in-flight + stale-attempt guards, client-side 3-reports-per-chain cap, resume-verify).
  - `code/codeApi.ts`: `postRunReport` + `getVerifyState` + the `verification` field on the
    turn-result mirror.
  - `PlaygroundApp.tsx`: entering the workspace after generation now **auto-runs** the game, so
    the first build plays (and gets verified via resume-verify) without pressing ▶.

### Changed
- **`verifyRoundtrip.extractRuntimeErrors` accepts curated failure warns** (`/^\[airbotix\]/`,
  `Failed to load|process`, `Texture … missing|not found`, `Scene … not found`) — generic kid
  `console.warn` still never triggers a Stars-charged fix.
- **The raw console-error auto-fix path (`/code/verify-fix`) is retired for game projects**: the
  runner no longer wires `onRuntimeErrors` → `autoFixFromErrors`; game verification goes through
  the server-adjudicated run-report loop. The code path stays compiling (and the co-debug bubble
  copy now comes from the server).

## 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **2D→3D conversion no longer deletes the kid's imported assets (Game Studio, D-3D-08 ×
  D-3D-09).** Converting a game between engines ("make it 3D") rebuilds it on a clean
  starter, and `resetEngine` was replacing the *entire* VFS with just that starter — so a
  `.glb` (or any image/audio) the kid had just imported vanished the moment they went 3D to
  use it. The engine switch now drops only the old engine's **code** and carries the kid's
  uploaded **assets** (anything `kind:'asset'` or under `assets/`) across the rebuild; the
  port prompt also names the preserved assets so the agent can wire the model into the new
  3D game. New shared `isAssetFile` helper (`panes/assetMeta.ts`) is the single definition of
  "is an asset" (the Asset Viewer's local `isAsset` now delegates to it). Tests:
  `useGameAgent.test.ts` (engine switch preserves `assets/` files + drops old code + names
  them in the port prompt); harness `kid-playground-model` extended to prove a just-imported
  `.glb` survives the 2D→3D switch end-to-end (real `PATCH engine` + saveVfs, DB `vfs_version`
  bump, authed `GET …/code/files` still lists the model, card still in the Assets pane).
- **Turn-result assets no longer come back as un-renderable raw base64 (`code/codeApi.ts`).** A
  turn result carries the FULL post-turn VFS (`readAllFiles`), and the backend returns binary
  assets as raw base64 — but only the snapshot/save reads mapped `toStudioContent` (which wraps
  them back into the `data:` URLs the `VfsFile` contract requires); the four turn-result paths
  (`runAgentTurn`, `streamAgentTurn`, `approveTurn`, `reportRuntimeErrors`) returned them raw. So
  after any AI turn, an imported image/audio/`.glb` that rode along in the VFS landed in the
  studio store as bare base64 and failed to render ("Couldn't open this 3D model"). This was most
  visible right after the 2D→3D switch (its rebuild turn re-applies the whole VFS incl. the
  just-preserved model). All four paths now normalize via a shared `toStudioTurnResult`
  (`changes[].after` left as raw base64 — the diff view expects that). Test: `codeApi.test.ts`
  (turn-result asset base64 → `data:` URL; text + `changes[].after` untouched).

### Added
- **GLB 3D-model assets in the Game Studio Asset Viewer (learn-game-studio-3d-prd D-3D-09,
  resolves OQ-3D-2).** Kids can now (1) **import** animated `.glb` models from local
  (file picker / drag-drop — `glb` joins `IMPORTABLE_EXTENSIONS`, same ≤50 MB confirmed-upload
  reveal), (2) **preview** them in a new lazy-loaded three.js stage (`panes/ModelPreview.tsx`:
  lit scene, orbit controls, auto-framing) with **every animation clip listed as a switchable
  chip** (first clip autoplays, crossfade on switch, play/pause; own chunk — three.js stays out
  of the main bundle), and (3) **reference** them in the AI chat — new `AssetKind 'model'` with a
  kind-aware "Copy 3D model reference" (bare VFS path, D-ASSET-15 contract). The sandbox chain:
  `GLTFLoader` is now bundled into the vendored `window.THREE` global (`vite.config.ts`
  `THREE_ADDONS`), and `.glb` is inlined as `model/gltf-binary` data URLs (`ASSET_MIME` +
  `BINARY_ASSET_MIME`) so a three game loads a referenced model with `THREE.GLTFLoader`.
  Tests: `assetMeta.test.ts` (model kind + label), `buildGamePreview.test.ts` (glb inlining),
  a new Asset Viewer GLB import e2e (upload → clips switch → chat ref) and a 3D game-smoke e2e
  (a three game loads the animated `.glb` via the global, plays a clip, runs clean); fixture
  `e2e/fixtures/spin.glb` (+ its deterministic generator `make-spin-glb.mjs`).
  Preview polish (user feedback): animation chips show the **short kid-facing label** — the last
  `|` segment of rig-namespaced exporter names ("CharacterArmature|Death" → "Death"; full name on
  the tooltip, collisions keep full names — `clipLabels` in `assetMeta.ts`); clips live in their
  own **Animations panel** (count + play/pause + scrollable chips + hint) instead of a loose chip
  row; the stage gains **zoom in / zoom out / reset-view** buttons; and a **"Copy name"** button
  copies the active clip's FULL name (what `AnimationClip.findByName` needs) for the AI chat.
  Fixture clips renamed to `CharacterArmature|Spin`/`|Bob` so the e2e proves shortening + full-name
  copy against realistic exporter output.

### Changed
- **One inline Copy behaviour everywhere in the Asset Viewer (user feedback).** The reference
  blocks (My assets / Library / Class) now use the same "Copied!"-on-the-button pattern as the
  Animations "Copy name" — a shared `CopyButton` component (clipboard write + 1.5 s check-icon
  confirmation) replaces the three hand-rolled Copy buttons and the copy-ref snackbar; the
  snackbar stays for import/upload/class-add outcomes. e2e assert the inline `Copied!` state and
  read the clipboard for the exact reference.
- **3D model grid cards show the actual model (user feedback).** The Asset Viewer card for a
  `.glb` renders a real framed still of the model (new lazily-imported `modelThumbnail.ts`: one
  shared offscreen WebGL renderer, serialised renders, cached by content, icon fallback for
  unparsable files) instead of the generic box icon. Shared scene plumbing (guarded loading
  manager, stage lights, auto-framing) extracted to `modelScene.ts`, now used by both
  `ModelPreview` and the thumbnailer — three.js remains a lazy chunk, out of the main bundle.
- **Asset Viewer feedback is a snackbar, never a banner (user feedback).** Every Asset Viewer
  operation notice ("Reference copied…", import results/blocks, upload failures, class-asset
  add/errors) previously rendered as a layout-shifting banner strip across the top of the pane;
  it is now a floating, auto-dismissing (3 s) snackbar pill at the bottom of the pane
  (`role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, success/error tone icons, `pg-snack-in` slide-up honoring
  `prefers-reduced-motion`). e2e assertions pinned to the `asset-snackbar` testid so a banner
  regression fails the suite.

### Fixed
- **`GLTFLoader is not available` / 3D models not loading — stale immutable cache of the vendored
  engine (learn-game-studio-3d-prd D-3D-09).** The self-hosted `/vendor/` engine globals had a
  FIXED, version-only filename yet shipped `immutable, max-age=1yr` (deploy.yml) with CloudFront
  invalidation covering only `/index.html` — so the D-3D-09 deploy that added `GLTFLoader` to the
  `window.THREE` bundle overwrote the same URL, and any browser/edge that had cached the pre-GLTFLoader
  bytes kept serving them for a year (a `THREE` with no `GLTFLoader` → the sandbox game threw; the
  model never loaded). Refreshing flipped it because different caches were hit. Fix: the
  `vendor-engines` plugin now emits **content-hashed** filenames (`three-<v>-<hash>.global.js`,
  `phaser-<v>-<hash>.min.js`/`.d.ts`) so the URL changes iff the bytes do — `immutable` becomes
  correct and a stale cache can never mask an engine change. The app reads the resolved URLs from a
  new `virtual:engine-vendors` module (`buildGamePreview.ts` + `MonacoEditor.tsx`) instead of
  hardcoding paths; no engine-path constants remain. Guarded by the 3D game-smoke e2e (asserts the
  srcdoc loads a `three-<v>-<8hex>.global.js` URL) + the `.d.ts` lazy-load e2e (hash-tolerant).
- **Detail-view 3D preview intermittently showed "Couldn't open this 3D model" while the list
  thumbnail rendered fine.** `ModelPreview` loaded the model with `GLTFLoader.load(blobURL)` — a
  real `fetch()` of an object URL, with a blob lifecycle that could race StrictMode/cleanup and that
  a strict `connect-src` CSP can block — whereas the working grid thumbnail parses the raw bytes.
  `ModelPreview` now uses the same `GLTFLoader.parse(arrayBuffer)` path (no blob URL, no network
  fetch, same sub-resource guard), so the detail stage is as robust as the thumbnail. Covered by the
  cross-repo `kid-playground-model` journey (the stage renders + clips switch after a real reload).
- **e2e mock harness caught up with the direct-to-S3 asset save + chat-ref copy.** The
  route-mocked backend (`e2e/helpers.ts`) never mocked `vfs/assets/sign-upload`/the S3 PUT, so
  every Asset Viewer import e2e silently failed since the presigned-upload save shipped; it now
  mirrors the real sign → PUT bytes → save-with-references flow (CORS included) and rebuilds
  asset content from the uploaded bytes. Also updated three stale specs: copy-ref expectations
  (loader snippet → bare chat reference + new notice, PR #86 behaviour) and the `.txt` import
  test (text files are BLOCKED from import by design — asserts the block notice). Added a
  GET `/projects/:id` mock (regex-scoped so Vite module URLs under `…/projects/…` aren't
  swallowed) with a new `engine` option for three-engine specs, and the game-signal recorder now
  captures info logs (`__smokeLogs`).

### Changed
- **Class-code login (`/learn/class-code`) now requires a display name.** The "What do you want
  to be called?" field was labelled `(optional)`; a kid could join with no name. It is now
  required (trimmed, 1–40 chars) with an inline validation error ("Please tell us your name."),
  matching the "At class" request form which already required a typed name. Added
  `ClassCodePage.test.tsx` covering the empty-name block, the removed `(optional)` label, and a
  successful submit.

### Fixed
- **Login mode toggle restyled to match the Learn design language.** The "Family code / At class"
  tabs were a heavy ink-filled pill next to a flat sky wash — off-style for the kid surface.
  Now a proper segmented control: warm `surface` track with a white active pill (`bg-canvas-pure` +
  `shadow-card-soft`), same recipe as the My Works segment chips.
- **Login toggle uses Lucide icons, not emoji.** The 👪 / 🏫 emoji became line icons (`Users` /
  `School` from `lucide-react`, 16px, matching the app's icon set) for a cleaner, on-brand look.

## 2026-07-02

### Added
- **"At class" login mode on `/learn/login` (auth-system-prd §5.3).** The kid login page now has
  a two-tab toggle: "👪 Family code" (unchanged) and "🏫 At class" — for enrolled kids who forgot
  their family code/PIN while at class. The kid types the class code from the board + their name
  (free text), which creates a pending login request; a friendly waiting screen ("✋ Ask your
  teacher to let you in!") polls every 3s until the teacher approves from teacher-console, then
  the kid lands in `/learn` on their REAL account (own projects/stars, short 4h session). Denied /
  expired / offline states get kid-friendly copy; the pending request survives reloads via
  sessionStorage; a `consumed` poll (tokens already taken by another tab / pre-reload poll)
  recovers through silent `/auth/refresh?kind=kid`. New `ClassLoginForm` + `ClassLoginWaiting`
  components, `createClassLoginRequest` / `pollClassLoginRequest` in `useAuth`, response types in
  `auth/types.ts`, and a 7-case component test (`ClassLoginFlow.test.tsx`). The one-shot workshop
  flow at `/learn/class-code` is unchanged.

## 2026-07-02 (Playground chat composer: attach-button polish)

### Changed
- The chat composer's attach-a-picture button is now a proper round chip (bordered, surface
  background, sky accent on hover) instead of a bare icon, and the composer row gained symmetric
  left padding — so it visually pairs with the round send button instead of hugging the border.

## 2026-06-30 (Playground AI chat: image input — upload + clipboard paste, FE half)

### Added
- **Kids can attach pictures to a playground chat turn so Airo "sees" them** (playground-ai-prompt-prd
  D-PAP-33..37, dark-launch). The composer (`AIChatPanel`) gains a picture button (`chat-attach-btn`) +
  hidden multi-file `<input accept=image/png,image/jpeg,image/webp,image/gif multiple>` and an `onPaste`
  handler that pulls image files off the clipboard. Each attachment shows a thumbnail strip above the
  textarea (`chat-attachment`, remove via `chat-attachment-remove`) — a spinner while it uploads, a red
  rejected state on failure. Send allows **text OR images**, is blocked while any attachment is still
  uploading, and clears both on send. The attached pictures render in the kid bubble from a **local
  preview URL** (the S3 key never reaches the bubble). All image affordances are hidden under `readOnly`
  (teacher viewer) and when the dark-launch flag is off.
- `codeApi`: `ChatImageRef = { s3_key; mime }`; `signChatImageUpload(projectId, { contentType, sizeBytes })`
  (POST `…/code/chat-image/sign-upload`, same `SignedUpload` shape the asset save uses); `uploadChatImage`
  (client MIME allow-list + ≤5 MB + optional canvas downscale to ≤1536px, presign, then a raw browser→S3
  PUT via the new shared `putToSignedUrl` — also reused by `uploadAssetToS3`). `runAgentTurn` /
  `streamAgentTurn` carry `images?` in the body **only when non-empty** (max 4). The kid still NEVER calls
  an LLM directly — only `platform-backend` (CLAUDE.md #5).
- `useGameAgent`: `send(text, opts?: { guided?; images? })` — relaxes the empty-text guard for an
  image-only ask, **skips the text classify** when there are no words, threads the S3 refs into
  `deps.runTurn`, and renders the local previews in the kid bubble. A `MODERATION_REJECTED` error with
  `details.modality:'image'` maps to an image-specific friendly message (`IMAGE_REJECT_MESSAGE`);
  `IMAGE_INPUT_DISABLED` (flag off) maps to the "pictures aren't available right now" message
  (`IMAGE_DISABLED_MESSAGE`) and latches the affordance hidden. Both paths charge **0 Stars**, leave no
  broken pending bubble, and clear the staged image(s).

### Tests
- `codeApi.test.ts`: `images` in the turn body only when present (omitted for text / empty list);
  `signChatImageUpload` + `uploadChatImage` presign→PUT path; MIME / oversize client-guards reject before
  any network call; S3 PUT failure surfaces an `ApiError`.
- `useGameAgent.test.ts`: image refs (not preview URLs) forwarded to `deps.runTurn`; image-only send skips
  classify; image reject → image copy + 0 Stars + staged image cleared; text reject keeps the generic
  copy; `IMAGE_INPUT_DISABLED` → not-available copy + affordance hidden.
- `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`: paste → thumbnail (uploading → ready); remove; send disabled while uploading;
  image-only send forwards refs + preview and clears the strip; picker via the hidden input; `readOnly`
  and flag-off hide the picture button; non-image paste ignored; reject-nonce clears the strip; kid bubble
  renders attached previews.

## 2026-06-29 (Fix: large asset thumbnails/previews broke in the asset viewer)

### Fixed
- **A large uploaded image rendered in the game but its asset-viewer thumbnail + detail preview were
  broken** (Chrome `blocked:other`). Cause: a multi-MB asset's `data:` URL is refused by the DOM
  `<img>`/`<video>`/`<audio>`, even though the sandboxed game's Phaser loader tolerates it — so the same
  asset worked in-game but not in the viewer. Now the asset viewer renders media from a short-lived
  `blob:` URL (`useObjectUrl` → `URL.createObjectURL`), which the DOM loads reliably and far more cheaply
  (no re-decode of a megabytes-long attribute each render); the object URL is revoked on unmount. The
  runtime/game is unchanged (still inlines `data:` URLs). Applied to the grid thumbnail (`Thumb`), the
  detail preview (`AssetPreview`: image/sprite/video/audio/lightbox), and dimension decoding. Library
  assets (CloudFront URLs) pass through unchanged.

### Tests
- `useObjectUrl.test.ts`: data: → blob: + revoke-on-unmount; non-data URL passthrough; throw → safe
  fallback to the data URL.

## 2026-06-29 (Game studio: tighten the asset importer to supported types only)

### Changed
- The import file picker now offers **only the types that can actually be saved** — its `accept` is
  derived from the single `IMPORTABLE_EXTENSIONS` list (no `image/*` wildcard). **`.svg` is excluded**
  (it's script-capable + the backend treats it as scanned text, so it was never uploadable as an asset);
  previously the picker offered it and the import then failed the save. Executable text (`.js/.html/.css`)
  stays blocked with a clear message (also covers drag-drop).

## 2026-06-29 (Game studio: import data files — JSON, fonts, shaders — as assets)

### Added
- The asset importer now accepts **non-executable data files** alongside media: `.json` (sprite
  atlas / tilemap / level data), `.xml`, `.csv`, fonts (`.ttf/.otf/.woff/.woff2`), `.fnt`, shaders
  (`.glsl/.frag/.vert`), `.atlas`. They import + upload like images and inline as data: URLs at
  runtime (Phaser `load.json`/`load.atlas`/`load.bitmapFont` accept data: URLs). MIME maps
  (`binaryAssetMime`, `ASSET_MIME`) extended so they round-trip across reload.
- Import **type guard** (`IMPORTABLE_EXTENSIONS`) + a broadened `accept` filter: unsupported /
  executable files (`.js/.html/.css/…`) are blocked at import with a clear "not a supported file
  type" message (also covers drag-drop, which ignores `accept`).

### Fixed
- `toStudioContent` now gates the base64→data: URL conversion on `kind === 'asset'`, so a `.anim.json`
  **text** sidecar (whose extension matches the JSON MIME) is no longer mis-wrapped as a data URL.

### Tests
- `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`: a `.json` import is accepted (kind `asset`); a `.js` import
  is blocked with the type message and nothing reaches the VFS.

## 2026-06-28 (Game studio: raise the asset import cap to 50 MB)

### Changed
- **`AssetViewerPane` import cap 16 MB → 50 MB** (`MAX_ASSET_BYTES` / `MAX_ASSET_LABEL`), matching the
  backend `MAX_FILE_BYTES` raise. Over-cap files are still hard-blocked at import with a clear
  "max 50 MB" message (never imported then lost). Feasible now that asset bytes upload direct-to-S3
  rather than as base64 in the save body.

### Tests
- `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`: the over-cap block boundary updated to >50 MB / "max 50 MB".

## 2026-06-27 (Game studio: assets upload direct to S3, not via nginx)

### Changed
- **Asset bytes now upload straight to S3 (presigned PUT); the VFS save sends a reference.** Previously a
  save serialised every asset as base64 in the JSON body and re-sent the whole VFS — so a >1 MB asset hit
  nginx's 1 MB request cap (413). Now `saveVfs` uploads any **dirty** asset (newly imported / renamed)
  to S3 via a presigned PUT (`POST …/vfs/assets/sign-upload` → raw `fetch` PUT, bypassing nginx + the
  JSON body), then saves a manifest of **text inline + assets as references** (`{path, uploaded:true}`).
  Clean assets (already in S3 at their path) are referenced, not re-uploaded.
- **`PlaygroundApp` tracks which asset paths are confirmed in S3** (`syncedAssetsRef`, seeded on load +
  after each successful save). On save it computes the dirty set; rename/move is handled automatically
  (the new path isn't synced → uploaded). AI-turn assets are marked synced (the backend already wrote
  them). `importFiles` is unchanged — the confirmed-upload seam reveals the asset only once the save
  (incl. its upload) succeeds, and rolls back on failure.
- The load path + runtime are **unchanged**: the GET still returns assets as base64 (responses aren't
  body-limited), `toStudioContent` wraps them back into `data:` URLs, and the sandbox still inlines those
  URLs — so the security model (no S3/signed URL inside the iframe) holds by construction. Removed the now
  unused `toBackendContent` (data-URL→base64 stripper).

### Tests
- `codeApi.test.ts`: a dirty asset is presigned + PUT to S3 then sent as a reference (no base64 in the
  save); a clean asset is referenced without re-uploading; text saves inline as `{path, content}`.

## 2026-06-26 (Asset import: confirmed-upload model + "Uploading…" indicator)

### Changed
- **An imported local asset now appears in "Mine" only AFTER its upload is confirmed.** Previously
  `importFiles` added the file to the VFS optimistically (it showed instantly, then the debounced save
  ran later — so a failed save left a phantom asset that vanished on reload). Now the import:
  1. reads the file and adds it to the VFS but keeps it **hidden** (`pendingPaths`) until confirmed;
  2. **awaits the backend save** via a new `onSaveNow` seam (`PlaygroundApp.flushSave`, threaded through
     `Workspace`); 3. **reveals** the asset on `saved`, or **rolls it back** (removes it) with a clear
     error on any other result. So an asset is never shown as available unless the backend stored it.
- **Added a clear "Uploading …" indicator**: the Import button shows a spinner + "Uploading…" and is
  disabled, with an "Uploading <name>…" line below, for the whole read+upload — no more silent freeze
  on a large (up to 16 MB) file.

### Tests
- `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`: a confirmed (`saved`) import is hidden during upload then
  revealed + persisted; a failed (`rejected`) upload shows an error and leaves nothing in the grid or
  the VFS (rolled back). `PlaygroundApp.flushSave` now returns its `SaveResult`.

## 2026-06-26 (Fix: imported assets vanished on reload — size cap + honest save, D-CODE-Q6)

### Fixed
- **An imported image showed in "Mine" but disappeared after refreshing the project.** The Asset
  Viewer only *warned* at 4 MB and imported anything, but the backend rejected any file over its
  500 KB cap (`VFS_FILE_TOO_LARGE`, HTTP 400) — and `saveProject` mislabelled that permanent 400 as a
  transient **"queued"** ("Saved on this device"). The next load read the server VFS (which never
  stored the asset) and overwrote the local cache, so the image was gone. Two fixes:
  - **`AssetViewerPane` now hard-blocks over-cap imports** (`MAX_ASSET_BYTES`, 16 MB to match the
    backend) with a clear message naming the file(s) and the limit — instead of importing then losing them.
  - **`saveProject` distinguishes a permanent 4xx from a transient network failure**: a 4xx returns a
    new `rejected` result (was lumped into `queued`). `PlaygroundApp` maps it to a new **`error`** save
    status and the Taskbar shows "Couldn't save" (⚠) — never a false "Saved on this device".

### Changed
- Raised the import cap from a 4 MB *soft warning* to a **16 MB hard block** so kids can import large
  sprite sheets / short audio (paired with the backend cap raise to 16 MB / 48 MB-project). INTERIM —
  true 50 MB sprites/video is a presigned direct-to-S3 upload follow-up (the whole VFS is re-sent as
  base64 on every save, so 50 MB doesn't fit the current path).

### Tests
- `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`: an over-cap (>16 MB) import is blocked with a clear message
  and adds nothing to the VFS. `projectPersistence.test.ts`: a permanent 4xx save returns `rejected`
  (not `queued`).

## 2026-06-26 (Fix: /try blocks demo broke network isolation → red CI)

### Fixed
- **The `/try/blocks` demo fired a real `GET /projects/:id`**, breaking its "zero network" contract
  (try-demo-mode-prd D-DEMO-02) and turning `TryBlocksPage.test.tsx` red on `main`. `useProjectBackTo`
  (the Blocks/Code studios' class-aware Home link) ran its react-query fetch even under the demo, which
  has no class and overrides Home itself. It now **disables the query in demo mode** (`useDemoMode()`),
  so the demo makes no network call and the back-link falls back correctly. Restores green CI for the repo.

## 2026-06-26 (Game Studio: modern "AI is thinking" indicator)

### Changed
- **Replaced the spinning brand orb in the game-studio chat with a modern treatment.** While an AI
  turn runs, the `WorkingCard` (and its `ThinkingBubble` fallback) now show a **breathing
  brand-gradient dot** (`.pg-breathe-dot` — scale + soft glow, no rotation) beside a **shimmering
  status line** (`.pg-shimmer-text` — a brand-tinted highlight band sweeps across the dim copy via
  `background-clip:text`). The "fixing 🔧" beat tints the dot warm amber. Both animations are held
  still under `prefers-reduced-motion` (the shimmer falls back to solid dim text). Removes the old
  `pg-orb-spin` / `pg-ring-arc` SVG ring from these two components.
- **Dropped the trailing emoji from every status line** in the indicator (`turnProgress.ts` step /
  filler / file labels + `ThinkingBubble` `THINKING_LINES`) — e.g. "Thinking it through 🤔" → "Thinking
  it through", "Adding Aliens ✍️" → "Adding Aliens". Cleaner copy alongside the new shimmer. (The
  *leading* file-row icons in the settled message's change list, `fileEmoji`, are unrelated and unchanged.)

### Tests
- `WorkingCard.test.tsx`: asserts the breathing dot (`pg-breathe-dot`, `working-dot` test id)
  replaces the spinning ring (no `pg-orb-spin` / `pg-ring-arc`), the label shimmers (`pg-shimmer-text`),
  and the fixing beat switches the dot to `pg-breathe-dot--fixing`. `AIChatPanel.test.tsx` unchanged + green.

## 2026-06-24 (Learn: unify the kid create entry points, D-MC-14)

### Fixed
- **"My Works" → "+ New project" no longer opens a drifted, partly-broken modal.** The
  `ProjectsListPage` `NewProjectModal` had its own `Image/Story/Music/Blank` starter list that had
  diverged from the Create tab's shared `CREATE_TOOLS` registry — it omitted Voice/Video/Code/Blocks,
  and its **"Story" tile routed to `/learn/create/story`, which is not a registered route**: it POSTed
  an orphan `line_a_creative` project and then dead-ended on `NotFoundPage`.

### Changed
- **"+ New project" now navigates to the Create tab (`/learn/create`)** — the single create surface
  (rendered from `CREATE_TOOLS`, shared with the in-class "Create for this class" sheet), so the tool
  list can no longer drift between entry points. Deleted the bespoke `NewProjectModal` + `STARTER_TILES`.
- Removed the redundant **"📂 My Works" page heading** from `ProjectsListPage`.

### Tests
- `ProjectsListPage.test.tsx`: asserts "+ New project" routes to `/learn/create` (no `/projects` POST,
  no "What are you making?" modal) and that the "My Works" heading is gone. Existing grouping / ⋯
  placement / wall-event tests unchanged and green.

## 2026-06-23 (Game Guide → full concept-first KB with interactive diagrams, D-HELP-08)

### Added
- **Interactive diagrams** (`panes/help/helpDiagrams.tsx`): a curated set of pokeable widgets on
  the existing `diagram` block — `coords-explorer` (drag x/y, toggle 2D/3D for z), `sprite-vs-mesh`,
  `camera-view` (pan vs orbit), `game-loop-stepper`, `collision-overlap`, `gravity-jump`,
  `scene-tree` — plus new static concept SVGs (engine-parts, materials-lights, input-keys, velocity,
  tween-curve, hud-score, win-lose, levels, juice). Theme-aware, keyboard-accessible, caption fallback.

### Changed
- **Help pane is now a 3-level tree** (branch → section → doc) sorted by `order` (`HelpPane.tsx`);
  `helpTypes.ts` gains `section?`/`order?` + the concept-branch `Pillar` union. The corpus is
  fetched as before; both 2D + 3D content always shows (engine-agnostic, D-HELP-08).
- Regenerated the bundled demo corpus (`pages/try/demoHelp.playground.ts`) as a verbatim copy of the
  new backend corpus (drift alarm green).

### Tests
- `helpDiagrams.test.tsx` (new): diagrams render + respond (toggle 3D, Step, expand tree, unknown-key
  fallback). `helpApi.test.ts` / `HelpPane.test.tsx` / `demoHelp.playground.test.ts` /
  `demoAdapters.test.ts` migrated to the new ids/structure. (Pre-existing `TryBlocksPage` zero-network
  flake unaffected.)

## 2026-06-23 (Game Studio 3D — fix the real switch root cause: runner snapshot, D-3D-08)

### Fixed
- **The actual cause of "Phaser/THREE is not defined" on a 2D⇄3D switch (both directions).**
  `GameRunnerPane` runs a `runKey`-gated SNAPSHOT of the VFS, but the `engine` prop is live — so
  on a switch the engine flipped while the runner kept the OLD engine's snapshot files, running
  them under the new global. Now the runner **re-snapshots when `engine` changes** too (not only
  on a runKey bump), so the iframe reloads the clean target-engine files together with the new
  global. (Earlier `flushSync`/reset fixes were necessary but insufficient — the runner ignored
  the live files.) Verified end-to-end in a real browser: toggling phaser→3D→2D on the **mounted**
  runner renders a canvas each time with zero "is not defined" errors. The DEV `/playground-sandbox`
  now drives `GameRunnerPane` (engine as a prop, no remount) so it reproduces the studio switch.

## 2026-06-23 (Game Studio 3D — fix switch crash + atomic engine flip, D-3D-08)

### Fixed
- **Full-screen crash on the switch rebuild** (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'split')`
  in `AIChatPanel.changedLineRange`). A whole-game rebuild creates NEW files whose diff `before`
  is null; `changedLineRange`/`buildChangedFiles` now coerce null `before`/`after` to `''` instead
  of `.split(null)`. (Regression test added.)
- **"Phaser is not defined" still flashed on confirm** — the switch updated the engine (React
  state) and the VFS (Zustand store) in separate ticks, so the runner briefly rendered the old 2D
  files under the new 3D global. The engine flip + clean-starter apply now run inside a single
  `flushSync`, so the runner only ever renders a consistent (engine, files) pair.

## 2026-06-23 (Game Studio 3D — fix the 2D⇄3D switch runtime + rebuild, D-3D-08)

### Fixed
- **Switch confirm emitted "Phaser is not defined" + restarted the old game; the rebuild
  then failed (twice).** The switch flipped the runner to three.js while the VFS still held
  the 2D Phaser files, so they ran under the 3D global; and the rebuild agent saw those 2D
  files and tried to edit them. Now confirming a switch **resets the VFS to the target engine's
  clean starter** (`resetEngine` = PATCH engine + `saveVfs` the starter) and flips the runner +
  shows that starter together — so no old files run under the new engine — then the agent
  rebuilds from the clean scaffold using a **port prompt** that carries the original game idea
  (the landing prompt), not the raw "make it 3D".

## 2026-06-23 (Game Studio 3D — wire engine end-to-end + 2D⇄3D switch, D-3D-07/08)

### Fixed
- **"Create a 3D game" was broken** — the create call hardcoded `template: 'phaser_blank'`, so a
  3D project was seeded with the 2D Phaser scaffold (stray `src/scenes/`), and the runtime never
  knew the engine so it loaded the Phaser global → the agent's three.js code threw "THREE is not
  available". Now `createGameProject` omits the template (the backend infers 2D/3D from the prompt
  and seeds the matching blank starter, D-3D-07), and the project's `engine` is loaded and threaded
  PlaygroundApp → Workspace → GameRunnerPane → GameFrame so the runner injects the right vendored
  global + control shim.

### Added
- **Kid-confirmed 2D⇄3D engine switch (D-3D-08).** Saying "make it 3D" / "turn it back to 2D" on an
  existing game is detected as a switch intent (`panes/engineSwitch.ts`: needs a switch verb + a
  clear other-engine cue, so "add 3D shadows" stays a normal edit) and — unlike every other game
  turn — is NOT auto-applied. It stages a **confirm card** ("Rebuild your whole game?") via the
  existing `pending`/`PendingCard` gate; on confirm it flips the engine (`PATCH /projects/:id`),
  re-points the runner, and rebuilds by re-running the request through the now-3D agent; on cancel
  nothing changes. `CodeProject.engine` + `setProjectEngine` added to the API client.
- **Second game engine — three.js (3D) runtime foundation** (`learn-game-studio-3d-prd.md`
  M3D-1/M3D-2, frontend slice). Phaser (2D) stays the default and is byte-identical.
  - `vite.config.ts`: generalized the `vendor-phaser` plugin → **`vendor-engines`**. Phaser's UMD
    global is still copied verbatim; **three.js (ESM-only since r160) is esbuild-bundled into a
    `window.THREE` global IIFE** (+ a curated addon set, currently `OrbitControls`) at
    `public/vendor/three-<v>.global.js` on every dev/build. Version-pinned (`THREE_VERSION`,
    throws on drift) — **no CDN** (platform rule), same contract as Phaser.
  - `buildGamePreview.ts`: introduced an **`EngineProfile`** (D-3D-03) that parameterizes only the
    engine-coupled srcdoc pieces — the vendored `<script src>`, the load guard, and the control
    shim. `BuildGameOptions.engine?: 'phaser' | 'three'` (default `phaser`, back-compat). Added the
    **three.js control shim** (D-3D-04): no `Phaser.Game` to wrap, so pause/resume/mute/snapshot
    ride a documented `window.__game` contract and FPS is read from the renderer's own frame
    counter (a stalled game reads 0) — **same `postMessage` wire protocol** as Phaser.
  - Installed `three@0.184.0` + `@types/three`.
  - `GameFrame` accepts an `engine` prop (default `phaser`) threaded into the builder; added
    `threeStarter.ts` (a lit, orbit-able spinning-cube three.js starter that follows the
    `window.__game` runtime contract — basis for the future `three_spin` template).
  - **DEV-only `/playground-sandbox`** route (`EngineSandboxDevPage`, `import.meta.env.DEV`-gated,
    excluded from prod) — a no-auth harness that runs the REAL `GameFrame` for either engine via a
    2D/3D toggle (`?engine=phaser|three`). Verified in headless Chromium: both engines render a
    canvas with positive FPS (Phaser 60, three.js 119) and zero game console errors.

### Tests
- `buildGamePreview.test.ts`: engine-profile suite — `engine` omitted ≡ `phaser` (byte-identical),
  `three` loads the three global + three control shim and not Phaser, kid script ranges +
  `//# sourceURL` + sandbox shell stay engine-agnostic, and both engines speak the same control
  wire protocol. (9/9 green; typecheck + production build green with the three global vendored.)

## 2026-06-22 (Live Mode — live focus presence, D-LIVE-3)

### Added
- **Report the kid's currently-open project to the teacher (D-LIVE-3).** New
  `src/pages/learn/liveClass/reportFocus.ts`: `useReportFocus(projectId, kind, title?, readOnly?)` emits
  `class.kid_focus { project_id, kind, title }` on the **kid** socket on mount and clears it (`project_id:null`)
  on unmount; **no-op outside a live class (`useKidClassId()` falsy) or in the teacher read-only viewer
  (`readOnly`)**. A module-level shared focus ref is re-emitted on the existing 10s heartbeat in `LearnLayout`
  so a teacher who opens Live Mode mid-session syncs within ~10s. Wired into the three VFS studios:
  `BlocksStudioPage` (kind `blocks`, project name as title), `code/CodeStudioPage` (kind `code`, `studio.title`),
  `playground/PlaygroundApp` (kind `game`). Compliance: ids + kind + title only, never file contents (C5).

### Tests
- `reportFocus.test.tsx`: emits on mount with project + kind + title; clears on unmount; no-op when not in a
  class / in readOnly / no projectId; the heartbeat re-emit (`reEmitFocus`) replays the current focus.

## 2026-06-22 (Live Mode — raise-hand + teacher nudge banner)

### Added
- **One-tap raise-hand in the Blocks + Game studios (D-LIVE-1, learn-game-studio J4).** New shared store/hook
  `src/pages/learn/liveClass/raiseHand.ts` (Zustand) — `raise()` / `lowerOwn()` emit `class.raise_hand` /
  `class.lower_hand` on the **kid** socket (no payload — the server takes class+kid from the JWT), and a
  `class.hand_lowered` listener syncs the button back to idle when the **teacher** lowers it. New
  `RaiseHandButton` (testids `ask-teacher` → `raise-hand-waiting`; a calm persistent "✋ Hand up · tap to
  lower" cue, not an alarm) wired into the Blocks studio top bar (`BlocksStudioPage`) and the Game studio
  taskbar (`desktop/Taskbar`, covers both Window + Split layouts). **Hidden in the teacher read-only viewer
  and when the kid is not in a class.**
- **In-class signal via the JWT `class_id` claim.** New `getKidClassId()` / `useKidClassId()` selectors in
  `authStore` decode the (unverified, UX-only) kid token to know whether the kid is in a live class — the
  same claim the WS gateway auto-joins on. Server remains authz source of truth.
- **Transient teacher→kid nudge banner (D-LIVE-2).** New `NudgeBanner` (hosted once in `LearnLayout`, like
  the heartbeat, so it shows across every studio) listens for `kid.nudge` and shows "✋ coming to help!"
  (canned) or the teacher's short note with an [OK] dismiss + auto-dismiss. **One-way only** — there is no
  reply control / text input (not a chat, no DMs).
- Tests: `raiseHand`/`RaiseHandButton` (visibility gating + raise/lower emits + teacher-lowered sync),
  `NudgeBanner` (canned vs note copy, no-reply one-way shape, dismiss), `authStore` (`class_id` claim decode,
  malformed-token safety).
## 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Game Studio Asset Viewer: a "Class" tab for the teacher's class shared asset library**
  (class-shared-assets-prd). When a kid's game project belongs to a class, the Asset Viewer
  shows a new **Class** source tab alongside Library / My assets, listing the media a teacher
  prepared for that class (`GET /projects/:id/class-assets` → `ClassAssetView[]`, via the
  shared `api` client). The tab appears **only** when the backend returns assets — the gate
  returns `[]` unless the project is class work for a class the kid is enrolled in (server is
  the source of truth for authz), so the frontend simply hides the tab when the list is empty
  (and never restores a persisted `class` source when none exist). Each asset previews by its
  short-lived signed `download_url`; **"Add to my game"** downloads those bytes, converts them
  to a `data:` URL, and copies them into the VFS at `assets/class/<name>` (deduped like an
  import) so the asset becomes a normal "My asset" — the signed URL is **never** referenced
  inside the sandboxed game (playground security model: a class asset enters the game only as
  a VFS file, exactly like an import). Copy-code-ref is offered too. In the teacher live
  read-only viewer (D-LV-6) "Add to my game" is hidden; preview/copy stay. New
  `panes/ClassAssets.tsx` (grid + detail), `listClassAssets` / `fetchAssetDataUrl` /
  `ClassAssetView` in `panes/playgroundApi.ts`, and `CLASS_ASSET_DIR` / `classAssetCodeRef`
  in `panes/assetMeta.ts`. Covered by `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`,
  `playgroundApi.test.ts`, and the umbrella harness journey `kid-class-asset`.
- **Class tab auto-refreshes live when the teacher changes the library** (class-shared-assets-prd):
  `Workspace` subscribes (via `useWsEvent`) to `class.asset_added` / `class.asset_removed` /
  `class.assets_copied` and invalidates the `['project', id, 'class-assets']` query, so a kid
  with the Asset Viewer open sees a newly-uploaded asset appear (or a removed one disappear)
  without reloading. The backend pushes a `class_id`-only signal to the enrolled kid's private
  socket room. Proven by the `kid-class-asset` journey (teacher uploads while the kid views →
  grid grows, no reload).

### Added
- **Full-screen image lightbox in the Asset Viewer** — image previews (My assets, Library, and
  Class) gain an **Enlarge** affordance (also click the image) that opens a zoomable full-screen
  overlay: zoom via +/− buttons, the mouse wheel, or the +/− keys; drag to pan; reset; close on
  ✕ / backdrop / Esc. New `panes/ImageLightbox.tsx` (rendered through a portal to `<body>` so the
  playground's transformed `react-rnd` window can't clip it). Covered by `ImageLightbox.test.tsx`,
  a wiring case in `AssetViewerPane.classAssets.test.tsx`, and the `kid-class-asset` journey.

### Changed
- **"Use it in your code" → "Copy {image/sound/video} reference"** in the Asset Viewer detail
  (all sources). Kids vibe-code through the chat, not by hand-pasting Phaser code, so the copied
  payload is now just the asset's **bare reference** — its VFS path (e.g. `assets/class/hero.png`),
  or the stable URL for a shared-library asset — instead of a `this.load.image(...)` snippet. The
  kid pastes it into the chat and the agent reads/loads it. Heading is kind-aware (`referenceLabel`);
  helpers renamed `codeRefFor`/`libraryCodeRef`/`classAssetCodeRef` →
  `assetChatRef`/`libraryChatRef`/`classAssetChatRef` in `assetMeta.ts`; a hint line tells the kid
  to paste it into the chat. ("Add to my game" still injects real loader code via `assetInsert.ts`.)
- **Asset Viewer source tabs fit one line with the Class tab present** — labels shortened
  ("My assets" → **"Mine"**) and made `whitespace-nowrap`/`truncate` so Library / Mine / Class
  no longer wrap in the narrow rail (testids unchanged: `asset-source-mine` etc.).

### Fixed
- **WS socket reuse (`lib/ws.ts`)**: `getSocket` no longer tears down a still-connecting socket
  on every call — it reuses the existing socket unless the token genuinely changed (a new
  login). Several concurrent subscribers (IncidentBanner + the playground Class-asset listeners)
  calling `getSocket` during the connect window caused a connect/disconnect storm that left
  listeners bound to discarded socket instances (so live events never arrived). New `ws.test.ts`.

## 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **Game Studio: an unavailable AI/safety service now shows a general error page, not the
  "your idea was a bit too rough" safety deflection.** When the input safety gate could not
  run (a classifier outage, or — common in local dev — the LLM provider not configured),
  the backend used to fail closed with `MODERATION_REJECTED`, indistinguishable from a real
  content block. So *every* prompt, however gentle, opened the workspace with the "too rough"
  message. The backend now returns a distinct `SAFETY_UNAVAILABLE` (503) for the
  service-can't-run case; `GeneratingScreen` routes it to `onError('service')` and
  `PlaygroundApp`'s `LoadErrorScreen` shows a general "something went wrong, try again"
  page (a real content refusal still opens the studio with the gentle deflection). The
  chat-edit path already maps 503 → a general "couldn't reach the AI" message. Covered by
  `GeneratingScreen.test.tsx` (`SAFETY_UNAVAILABLE` → error page, no workspace) and the
  umbrella harness journey `kid-playground-safety-unavailable`.

## 2026-06-21 (Blocks read-only viewer — edit controls DISABLED, not hidden — D-LV-6)

### Fixed
- **Teacher read-only Blocks studio now mirrors the kid's layout.** Read-only (`readOnly`) mode
  previously **HID** the edit-area controls (block palette, category bar, trash bin, add/remove
  character, add/remove page, scene/background picker, undo/redo), which broke the layout — an empty
  coding band and missing palette that no longer matched what the kid sees. These controls are now
  **RENDERED-but-DISABLED**: visible, inert (`pointer-events-none cursor-default`, `disabled` /
  `aria-disabled`), and subtly dimmed (`opacity-60`) via the shared `READONLY_EDIT_DISABLED` treatment.
  The viewed CONTENT (stage, characters, script chain, page thumbnails) stays full-opacity. The Home/back
  button stays HIDDEN (the viewer banner provides Back; a second back is wrong). Mutation handlers were
  already store-gated, so this is purely a stop-hiding + disable-visual change. `BlocksStudioPage.tsx`,
  `BlocksStudioPage.test.tsx` (read-only asserts controls PRESENT but non-interactive; kid mode stays
  interactive + Home present; mutation/autosave no-op proofs kept).
- **No more teacher 403s in the read-only Blocks viewer (kid-scoped write/read leaks).** Two calls fired
  for a teacher that only a kid may make: (1) the **on-load cover-thumbnail refresh** (`saveThumbnail`, a
  kid-scoped write) ran unconditionally — now gated behind `!readOnly`; (2) the **Share panel** ran its
  kid-scoped `getShareLink` query on mount — `BlocksSharePanel` now takes a `readOnly` prop that disables
  the query (`enabled: !readOnly`) and renders the Share button disabled + dimmed (visible for layout
  parity, never opens the sheet). Verified in a real browser: the teacher read-only Blocks viewer now
  loads with **zero 403s** and a layout identical to the kid's. `BlocksStudioPage.tsx`, `BlocksSharePanel.tsx`.

## 2026-06-20 (Class create sheet — second-level menu + Game Playground; "Tiny Game" rename)

### Added
- **"Create for this class" sheet now has a second-level menu (my-classes-prd §3.3).** Tapping the
  **Code Studio** tool no longer creates a blank `code` project directly — it opens an in-sheet sub-menu
  (with a `← Back`) offering **Web Code** (`{ kind:'code', template:'blank' }` → `/learn/code/:id`,
  today's behaviour) and **Game Playground** (`{ kind:'game', template:'phaser_blank' }` →
  `/learn/playground/:id`, matching `createGameProject` in `PlaygroundApp`). A game is now creatable
  directly from a class. All other tools (Blocks / Image / Music / Voice / Video) still create directly.
  Sub-types modelled via `CODE_SUBTYPES` / `SUBTYPES_BY_TOOL` in `CreateForClassSheet`; leaf create
  buttons keep `data-testid="create-tool"`, the sub-menu opener is `create-tool-submenu`, the back affordance
  `create-subtool-back`. New `CreateForClassSheet.test.tsx`.

### Changed
- **"Tiny Game" → "Game Playground" (display only).** The Code hub starter and all user-facing copy now
  read **Game Playground**; the internal template id `tiny_game` (routing / testids / template lookup) is
  unchanged. `codeApi.ts` starter `title`, plus clarifying comments in `router.tsx`,
  `LearnPlaygroundPage.tsx`, `CodeHubPage.tsx`. `codeApi.test.ts` asserts the renamed starter title.

## 2026-06-20 (Teacher LIVE viewer — render the kid's STUDIO EDITOR read-only — D-LV-6)

### Changed
- **Teacher LIVE viewer chrome → full-bleed "Style B" banner.** Dropped the bolted-on header + the
  bordered card frame around the studio. `TeacherProjectLivePage` is now **full-bleed** (`fixed inset-0`,
  breaking out of the centered TeacherLayout container) with a slim dark **"← · ● LIVE · You're watching
  <kid>'s project — <title> · 🔒 Read-only"** banner above the kid's own studio bar — so the teacher sees
  the studio exactly as the student does, with the live/read-only context on top. The studio's own
  **Home/back is hidden in `readOnly`** (blocks 🏠 now gated; code already gated) so the banner's Back is
  the only navigation (no bouncing a teacher into the kid Learn hub). `TeacherProjectLivePage.test` updated
  for the banner.

- **Teacher LIVE viewer now renders the kid's STUDIO EDITOR read-only**, not the read-only player
  (teacher-live-project-view-prd D-LV-6, supersedes the "render the player" part of v0.2). The teacher sees
  EXACTLY what the student sees while **building**: `game`→`PlaygroundApp`, `code`→`CodeStudioPage`,
  `blocks`→`BlocksStudioPage` — each with a new `readOnly` mode. `TeacherProjectLivePage` loads
  `GET /projects/:id` and renders the matching studio with `readOnly` + the projectId; it **remounts the
  studio** on each `project.vfs.changed` for this project so the kid's latest VFS re-loads live.
- Added a `readOnly?: boolean` prop to **`PlaygroundApp` / `Workspace` / `useGameAgent`**,
  **`CodeStudioPage` / `useCodeStudio` / `CodeChat`**, and **`BlocksStudioPage` / `blocksStore`**. In read-only:
  - **Every mutation entry point is gated.** Game: AI turns (send / confirm / reject / asset-gen / raise-hand /
    auto-fix), file create/rename/delete/move (FileTree), Monaco edits (editor `readOnly`), idle-autosave +
    all VFS/UI/chat persistence, asset upload / add-to-game / generate/remix. Code: chat composer + send +
    approve/reject (no-op + composer removed). Blocks: a single store gate on `_commit`/`undo`/`redo` makes
    every program mutation a no-op so `dirty` never advances (autosave can never fire), plus the palette,
    category bar, trash bin, add/remove character, add/remove page, scene picker, friend picker, undo/redo,
    block drag/tap-to-edit, and sprite drag are all disabled/hidden.
  - **Running stays live** (▶ Go! / Run anew / Play / tap-sprite-to-run / mute / theme) — non-destructive viewing.
  - **The kid-only wallet query is skipped** for a teacher (`user`) principal (game + code) — no family, no crash;
    balance is hidden ("—").
- The hard data backstop is unchanged: `PUT …/code/files` excludes `teacher`, so a teacher literally cannot save;
  the read-only client gating is the UX + defence-in-depth layer over it.
- The teacher-console deep-link (`…/teacher/projects/:id/live`) is unchanged and still works.

### Fixed
- **No dead edit affordances in the game read-only viewer (D-LV-6).** Two controls still rendered for a teacher
  even though their handlers were already gated (they call a no-op `send`), so a click did nothing — now they are
  hidden in `readOnly`: the Monaco **"✨ Explain this"** selection toolbar (its content widget + selection
  listener are no longer registered) and the Game Runner's **"Ask AI to fix"** console button.
- `useGameAgent` `cancelPending` / `lowerHand` / `retryLast` now early-return in `readOnly` (matching the other
  entry points) so the read-only contract is uniform and obvious, not merely inert-by-consequence.

### Tests
- `PlaygroundApp.readOnly.test.tsx` (new): a teacher (`user` principal, `family_id:null`) renders the game studio
  read-only without crashing and the kid-only **wallet + class** queries never fire; Monaco is non-editable, the
  FileTree CRUD buttons are absent + rows not draggable, and **no persist request is issued on mount**. Asserts the
  kid path is unchanged (editable Monaco, CRUD present, wallet/class queries fire).
- `GameRunnerPane.test.tsx`: asserts "Ask AI to fix" is hidden in `readOnly` (console still opens) and present for the kid.

## 2026-06-20 (Teacher — read-only LIVE project viewer — D-LV-1…5)

### Added
- **Teacher read-only LIVE project viewer** at `/teacher/projects/:projectId/live` (under `TeacherLayout`,
  `<ProtectedRoute kind="user">`). A teacher opens an enrolled kid's **class** project and watches it render
  **live, read-only** — no editor, no co-edit. Reuses the existing per-kind read-only renderers:
  `game`→`ReadOnlyGameFrame`, `code`→`PreviewFrame`, `blocks`→`ReadOnlyBlocksPlayer` (same wiring as
  `PublicPlayPage`; no duplication). Loads `GET /projects/:id` (kind/title/owner nickname) +
  `GET /projects/:id/code/files`, subscribes to the generalized **`project.vfs.changed`** WS event on the
  teacher socket and **refetches the VFS** so the renderer re-renders live for all three kinds. A small
  "👁 Watching live — read-only" header. `creative`/unknown kind → an honest "Live view isn't available for
  this project type yet" message (no crash); a 403/404 (server-enforced class-scope, D-LV-5) → a friendly error.

### Changed
- `useWsEvent` takes an optional `kind` (default `'kid'`) so the teacher (`user`) viewer can subscribe on
  the teacher socket.

## 2026-06-20 (Blocks Studio — autosave no longer reverts edits)

### Fixed
- **Blocks Studio: added/edited blocks no longer silently revert a few seconds later.**
  Autosaves weren't serialized. The save-version (`versionRef`) only advances when a save
  *returns*, so an edit made while a save was still in flight scheduled a second save that
  reused the same stale base `version` → the backend 409'd → the conflict handler reloaded
  the server's older snapshot via `load()`, discarding the in-flight edits (the canvas
  "travelled back in time"). Intermittent because it only triggered when an edit landed
  during an in-flight save (network-latency dependent). `BlocksStudioPage` now serializes
  autosaves with an in-flight mutex (`savingRef`) plus a trailing re-save (`pendingRef`):
  only one save runs at a time, and edits that arrive mid-save are persisted in a follow-up
  round using the version the previous save returned — eliminating the self-conflict.
  Genuine multi-device conflicts still surface kept-newest. Covered by a new
  `BlocksStudioPage` autosave-serialization test (red without the fix, green with it).

## 2026-06-19 (Learn — live wall-placement refresh)

### Fixed
- **Kid "My Works" now reacts to teacher wall placement live** —
  `ProjectsListPage` (`/learn/projects`) subscribes to the `wall.placement_changed`
  WS event (emitted to the kid socket by platform-backend `wall.service`
  `teacherPublish`/`teacherRemove`) and invalidates the kid projects query
  (`['projects','kid',kidId]`) so the placement badge updates without a manual
  refresh when a teacher publishes/removes a project to/from the class wall
  (`teacher-class-work-prd.md` §12.3, acceptance #5). Uses the standard
  `useWsEvent` idiom. New component test fires the event and asserts My Works
  refetches.

## 2026-06-16 (Teacher — "Student work" review view)

### Added
- **"Student work" view** in the teacher dashboard `ClassDashboardPage`
  (`/teacher/classes/:classId`) — `teacher-class-work-prd.md` §3/§6. A
  between-sessions REVIEW gallery: a `Live | Student work` tab; the Student-work
  tab renders, per enrolled kid, that kid's **class-work + on-the-wall** projects
  (thumbnail, title, kind, working/finished status, 🏫 on-wall badge) from the new
  `GET /classes/:id/student-work` (`getStudentWork` in `classApi.ts`). Opening a
  card reuses the EXISTING per-kid read-only route
  (`/teacher/classes/:classId/kids/:kidId` → `LiveViewPage`) — no new viewer. The
  live raised-hands queue is unchanged (the "who needs help" signal stays put,
  D-TCW-2). Design-system classes only (no raw hex); nickname-only — never kid
  PII; personal projects are never shown (server-enforced). New
  `StudentWorkView.tsx` + `StudentWorkView.test.tsx` (renders per-kid cards,
  asserts the GET call, opens a project via the existing route, empty state).

### Fixed
- **Student-work thumbnail** rendered the project's `thumbnail_s3_key` through a
  non-existent `/artifacts/:key` route (no such served path — the backend exposes
  artifacts only via signed download URLs), so previews always 404'd to the "no
  preview yet" fallback. Now renders the bare key as `<img src>`, matching the
  sibling kid `WorkCard`.

## 2026-06-16 (Learn — "My Classes" kid surface + project placement lifecycle)

### Added
- **My Classes** kid surface (my-classes-prd §2–§4), translating the approved
  `mocks/my-classes/` design to React + the K-12 design system (no raw hex):
  - **My Classes list** (`ClassroomListPage`) — enriched cards from
    `GET /classes/mine` (`ClassMineSummary`: cover, teacher + avatar, classmate
    count, progress bar, live/next chip, stars). **Active** + **Finished**
    sections; existing empty state preserved. `classCover.ts` gives each class a
    stable K-12 gradient + emoji fallback when there's no `cover_image_url`.
  - **Class hub** (`ClassHubPage`, replaces `ClassWallViewPage` at
    `/learn/classroom/:classId`) — tabbed shell: **Wall** (existing wall +
    6-emoji `ReactionBar`) · **My work** (the kid's projects for this class) ·
    **Lessons** · **Next class** (NO Classmates tab, D-MC-12). Lessons / Next
    class show a graceful "coming soon" until the kid sessions/progress reads
    exist (deferred — see below). In-place **"Create for this class"** sheet
    (`CreateForClassSheet`) — course-allowed tool gating is a TODO (backend
    `allowed_kinds` not built); shows the kid's permitted Create tools, defaults
    new work to **class work**.
  - **My Works** (`ProjectsListPage`) regrouped (my-classes-prd §3.4): segmented
    tabs **All · Personal · <each enrolled class>**; cards open the studio; a
    **⋯** placement menu wired to `PATCH /projects/:id/placement`
    (`WorkCard` + `usePlacement`): Personal → "Use for a class" (class picker);
    Class work → "Share with the whole class" (existing wall path) + "Move to
    Personal"; On the wall → "Take off the wall" + "Move to Personal". A `public`
    (internet-visible) work is its own honest, **non-mutable** placement ("Shared
    to the world" 🌐 badge, no ⋯ menu) — changing it stays behind the teacher+parent
    double-consent gate, never the kid menu (my-classes-prd §11). Visibility badge
    (Personal / Class work / On the wall / Public, Lucide icons) is separate from the
    Working/Finished status tag. Destructive "Move to Personal" requires a confirm
    (PRD §3.2); "Use for a class" shows the teacher-visibility consequence.

### Changed
- **Learn top-nav label** `Class wall` → **`My Classes`** (route
  `/learn/classroom` unchanged).
- **Create tab** (`CreateHubPage`) reframed as **personal-only** (default 🔒
  private); the in-class create flow lives in the hub sheet (no jump to Create).
  Tool list extracted to shared `create/createTools.ts` (reused by the sheet).
- `classroomApi.ts` — added `ClassMineSummary` + `listMyClasses()`, the
  `PATCH /projects/:id/placement` mover (`updatePlacement`, `PlacementAction`),
  and the four-state `ProjectVisibility` (`private | class_work | class | public`).

### Deferred / stubbed
- **Lessons** + **Next class** hub tabs render "coming soon" — they need the kid
  curriculum/progress + redacted sessions reads (my-classes-prd §6 V2). No
  fabricated data.
- **Course-allowed project kinds** in the "Create for this class" sheet (D-MC-11)
  — `CoursePack.allowed_kinds` isn't built; the sheet shows the kid's full
  permitted tool set with a code TODO.
- **Class-association from the "Create for this class" sheet** — the tool links
  still route to the bare studio route with no `class_id`, so work made there is
  not yet auto-attached to the class. The sheet copy is intentionally framed as
  intent ("can see it to help"), not a guarantee; flagged with a code TODO until
  the studios accept class context.

### Fixed
- **Privacy (review blocker):** a `public` (internet-visible) project was
  collapsed into the `on_wall` placement — it rendered the class-only "On the
  wall" badge and offered `take_off_wall` / `move_to_personal` on a
  double-consent project. `placementOf()` now maps `visibility:'public'` to a
  distinct `public` placement with an honest "Shared to the world" badge and
  **no** kid-mutable ⋯ menu (my-classes-prd §11; placement contract defines
  `take_off_wall`/`move_to_personal` only for `class`/`class_work`). Covered by
  new `WorkCard.test.tsx` cases.
- **Design-system:** removed the last inline hex tints (`text-[#8A6A00]` /
  `text-[#9A2861]`) from the placement badges (`WorkCard`) and the
  "Create for this class" sheet icon — now `text-ink` on the wash background, the
  established K-12 convention (DESIGN.md: no raw hex).

### Tests
- Component tests (vitest + Testing Library, `@/lib/api` mocked, no network):
  `ClassroomListPage.test.tsx` (enriched cards + Active/Finished + empty),
  `ProjectsListPage.test.tsx` (grouping + ⋯ placement menu asserting the PATCH
  action/class_id + destructive confirm), `ClassHubPage.test.tsx` (tab switching,
  no Classmates tab, coming-soon, create sheet), and a focused
  `WorkCard.test.tsx` (empty class-picker state, delete-only personal menu,
  outside-click close, class_work/on_wall menu actions, and the `public`
  honest-badge / no-mutable-actions privacy cases).
- **Harness:** the new frontend↔backend contracts (enriched `GET /classes/mine`
  / `PATCH /projects/:id/placement`) are logged as a blocked L3 gap in the
  umbrella `harness/COVERAGE.md` (backend endpoints not yet implemented — this is
  a FE-only diff with mocks-as-contract).

## 2026-06-16 (Learn + Portal — adopt the Lesson(content)/Mission(task) model split)

### Changed
- **Adopt the platform Mission/Lesson model split** (platform-backend
  `refactor/mission-to-lesson`). A pack's course content is now an ordered list of
  **Lessons (课节)** — `CoursePack → lessons[]` — and the kid's **Mission** is the TASK
  inside a Lesson (`Lesson → missions[]`). This supersedes PR #77, which had bluntly
  renamed **all** kid-facing "Mission" copy to "Lesson"; that was too broad under the new
  model. Reconciled to the real semantics:
  - **Content shape:** `course-packs` list & detail now consume `lessons[]` (each Lesson =
    `{ id, slug, title, description, order_index, missions: [] }`) instead of a flat
    `missions[]`. The pack content size = `lessons.length` (the numeric `mission_count` is
    still the total task count, no longer surfaced in copy).
  - **Catalog / 课节 = "Lesson":** Learn nav "Lessons", the catalog list, pack-detail
    headings, and per-pack/per-course counts stay "Lesson(s)" and now count Lessons.
  - **Task = "Mission" (restored):** in-classroom step eyebrows `Lesson step → Mission step`
    (`MissionCodeStep`, `MissionShareStep`), the code-step "meets the lesson → meets the
    mission" check, and the parent growth-tracker task studio (`kidGrowth.ts`: label
    `Lessons → Missions`, noun `lessons → missions`; key `mission` unchanged).
  - **Pack detail reworked** to `pack → Lessons (课节) → each Lesson's Mission task(s)`:
    every Lesson renders its nested Mission tasks, each with its own "Start →".
  - **Parent Portal course card** now shows `lessons.length` "lessons" (course-content
    count) instead of `mission_count`.
- **Renamed for clarity** (route id `/learn/missions` unchanged as the internal identifier):
  `MissionsListPage → LessonsCatalogPage`, `MissionDetailPage → PackLessonsPage`.

### Added
- `src/pages/learn/PackLessonsPage.test.tsx` — component test for the new
  pack → Lessons → Mission-task shape (lesson-count headline + nested task rendering).

### Changed (tests)
- `src/app/learnLessonCopy.test.tsx` now asserts the **split**: the catalog nav says
  "Lessons" (课节) while the kid TASK studio says "Missions".

## 2026-06-15 (test infra)

### Fixed
- **Vitest no longer collects specs from nested `.claude/worktrees/`.** A gitignored
  git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` leaked its own copy of the unit tests (run
  twice) and its Playwright `e2e/` specs into `npm run test`, where the e2e specs fail
  under jsdom (`HTMLCanvasElement.getContext not implemented`). The existing `e2e/**`
  exclude only matched the repo root, not nested worktree copies. Added `**/.claude/**`
  to `test.exclude` in `vite.config.ts` so the unit run is the real specs only.

## 2026-06-13 (Portal — tutoring page English localisation)

### Changed
- **Tutoring page (`/portal/tutoring`) fully localised to English.** All hardcoded Chinese
  UI copy translated — bill intro, "Your classes", Private/Official badges, "Teachers:",
  "Upcoming sessions" + empty state, course-outline toggle, "Amount due" / "Pay" / "Redirecting…"
  / all-caught-up message, "Lesson charges" table (Class / Students / Rate/hour / Duration /
  Amount / Status headers, Paid/Due badges). Session date formatting switched from `zh-CN`
  to `en-AU` locale.

## 2026-06-13 (Try demos — share is now a guided beat, D-DEMO-09)

### Added
- **The `/try/playground` and `/try/blocks` demos now WALK the share flow** instead of
  hiding it (supersedes D-DEMO-08's share-hiding; PRD `try-demo-mode-prd.md` v0.10). The
  tour opens the REAL `ShareLinkPanel` / `BlocksSharePanel`, fires the real "ask a grown-up"
  request → genuine `pending` state, simulates the grown-up's approval (the one
  preview-framed beat — "let's pretend they approved 👍", never a faked backend response)
  → `active` link, then opens `/play/:shareId` in a REAL new tab: the unmodified
  `PublicPlayPage` (now with the D-GAME10e brand frame). Playground gains a 4-card share
  block (tour 16→20 cards); blocks a matching block before free explore.
- **`setDemoShareAdapter` seam** (`sharingApi.ts`): an in-memory share lifecycle
  (`none → pending → active`) so the real panels render their real states with ZERO network
  to `/projects*`/`/share*`. Reset on entry, pristine on reload.
- **Bundled public snapshots** (`demoSnapshot.playground.ts` + `demoSnapshot.blocks.ts`):
  `readPublicSnapshot` resolves the two fixed demo shareIds (`try-demo-playground`,
  `try-demo-blocks`) from build-time constants with ZERO network — so a real new tab (a
  fresh JS context with no demo install) renders the real public play page offline. Reuses
  the demo's own starter game / "Cat's Day Out" story — genuine product content, no PII.

### Changed
- The real share panels read `useDemoMode()` and hand the tour their open/request/approve/
  open-recipient affordances via a new `bindShareControls` context seam; in demo the panel's
  auto-close on outside-click/backdrop is suppressed so the tour's Next never dismisses it
  mid-beat. All off-by-default — zero change to the authed product (demo context is `null`
  there). `Taskbar` surfaces the Share button in the project-less playground demo via a
  fixed demo share project id.

## 2026-06-13 (Public play page — brand frame polish)

### Fixed
- **Public play brand logo now vertically centred.** The base `logo-white-horizontal.png`
  carries ~99px of empty canvas below the ink (artwork in y[3–200] of a 300px-tall image),
  so an `items-center` logo sat visibly high. Added a tightly-trimmed asset
  `logo-white-horizontal-trim.png` (888×201, no padding) used only by `PlayBrandBar`, so
  centring is correct with no magic offset.
- **Public play brand frame: larger, aligned logo + correct "Make your own" target.**
  The AirBotix logo in `PlayBrandBar` was too small (`h-4`) and read as misaligned next to
  the "· shared creation" label; it's now `h-7` on a slightly taller (`h-14`) bar, vertically
  centred and balanced. The "Make your own" CTA now points to the marketing **`/programs`**
  page (was `/try`) — `marketingHref('/programs')`, so prod → `airbotix.ai/programs` and dev
  → the marketing server's `/programs`. Test + e2e assertions updated to `/programs`.

## 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Game Studio: a manual edit made right after an AI turn no longer reverts ("we kept
  your newest copy").** An applied AI turn bumps `Project.vfs_version` server-side, but
  the turn result carried no version, so the studio's save-version (`versionRef`) went
  stale; the next autosave sent a stale `expected_version` → 409 → the server's pre-turn
  copy won, silently reverting the kid's edit. The backend now returns `version` in the
  turn result (`AgentTurnResult`), `useGameAgent` passes it to `onApplyFiles`, and
  `PlaygroundApp` adopts it into `versionRef` (new `applyTurnFiles`) so the post-turn save
  is no longer stale. Genuine multi-device conflicts still surface kept-newest. Covered by
  harness journey `kid-game-edit-after-turn` (red without the fix, green with it).
## 2026-06-13 (Public play page — brand frame + dark container)

### Added
- **Brand frame on the public play page (`/play/:shareId`).** A slim `PlayBrandBar`
  now sits ABOVE the play surface (never an overlay — it cannot intercept a game/sprite
  tap): the AirBotix logo links back to the marketing site, and one soft, **first-party**
  "Make your own" CTA links to `/programs`. Both open a **new tab**, so a logged-out visitor
  (e.g. grandma, or a friend the kid shared with) never loses the running game. No kid
  PII, no auth, no LLM, no third-party ads (minors-compliance C14). New `src/lib/marketing.ts`
  resolves the marketing origin (prod → airbotix.ai, dev → :3000, `VITE_MARKETING_URL`
  override), mirroring the demo's exit URL. (learn-game-studio-prd D-GAME10e.)

### Changed
- **The public play container now defaults to the DARK theme on both surfaces.**
  `ReadOnlyBlocksPlayer` was hard-pinned to `data-theme="light"`; the public player (its
  only consumer) now renders dark, so the bright scene art floats on a dark frame and
  matches the game canvas. Scene art is constant across themes; only the chrome follows
  `data-theme`. The 410 gone state is deliberately left frame-less (a flat, PII-free dead end).

### Tests
- `PublicPlayPage.test.tsx` — the brand frame renders above the game canvas and the blocks
  player, with the logo + first-party `/try` CTA both new-tab; the blocks player defaults to
  dark; the gone state stays frame-less. `e2e/sharing-remix.spec.ts` J8 asserts the frame is
  the only chrome (studio testids still absent).

## 2026-06-12 (Game Studio — WorkingCard simplified: one ring, one line)

### Changed
- **The in-chat WorkingCard is now ONE line with ONE indicator.** The old card stacked a
  heading ("Working on it…"), a determinate progress bar (% from completed-step count,
  capped at 92% — read as real progress a turn doesn't have), and a growing step list.
  Now: a single spinning brand ring whose arc breathes (SVG `stroke-dasharray` animation,
  new `pg-ring-arc`; amber tones during the silent "fixing" beat) next to the current-state
  label — the latest real tool-delta label (e.g. "Adding Aliens ✍️"), or generic rotating
  fillers (`currentStateLabel`, 4s cadence) before the first delta lands. The heading was
  redundant with the state line; the bar was a second indicator with too much movement.
  Header clock stays; the "live" badge and per-step timers are gone too — the animated
  ring already signals liveness.

## 2026-06-12 
### Fixed (playground syntax-error locations, D-PAP-30)
- Syntax errors in a game now reach the console — and the AI self-fix
  round-trip — with the kid's real **file:line**. A script that fails to parse
  never gets its `//# sourceURL` applied, so the browser reported
  `about:srcdoc:N` (or nothing); `buildGamePreview` now returns each script's
  line range inside the srcdoc and `GameFrame` resolves error locations through
  it (`resolveErrorLoc`), dropping untranslatable host-chrome locations rather
  than misleading the fixer.

### Changed (blocks scroll polish)
- Every scrolling studio zone (character/page rails, category bar, palette,
  program area) now uses `FadeScroller`: native scrollbars are hidden (the
  custom `::-webkit-scrollbar` theme rendered as permanent gray bars on
  tablets); an iOS-style overlay thumb hugging the card edge (2px, inside the
  rounded corners) appears while scrolling and fades away when idle; and the
  edges fade ONLY towards hidden content (scroll-position-driven mask vars) —
  at a resting end nothing looks cut off. Same only-where-hidden fade idea as
  the playground HistoryPanel, generalised with the overlay thumb.

### Fixed (blocks portrait layout)
- Blocks Studio portrait/tablet layout no longer collapses: the zone-tag chips
  (D-BLK-13) kept their landscape column-header style (`width: 100%`) inside the
  portrait horizontal strips, so each tag swallowed its whole row and pushed the
  character thumbs, page thumbs and all six category buttons off-screen. In
  portrait the tags are now compact leading chips.
- Narrow portrait screens (≲530px) no longer clip ▶ Go! / the bin off the right
  edge: the studio's grid rows now shrink to the column (`min-width: 0`) and the
  toolbar title block truncates instead of widening the app.

### Fixed (tour navigation & placement)
- "Change a number" (blocks tour) anchors to the SIDES only — anchoring above the
  track covered the palette the card tells the user to drag from (caught by the
  harness journey's real palette click); falls back to its static top-right.

- Blocks demo: the story plays only on the FIRST arrival at the Press-Go card —
  after browsing Back, going forward just navigates (frontier semantics, like the
  playground), and a user's own Go press on a revisit is plain exploration.
- Tour cards no longer flash in from screen corners when a step's target is still
  resolving (an opening window, a not-yet-popped toolbar): the card HOLDS its last
  position until the new anchor lands ('pending' vs 'no-fit' anchor states).
- Landing card never touches the prompt box: anchors LEFT only, with fit decisions
  using the card's nominal width (a first-frame narrow measurement could approve a
  side the full card then overflowed onto the target); narrow viewports use the
  beside-input left column.


### Changed (anchored tour cards)
- **Tour cards now sit CLOSE to the spotlight area** (both demos): the card anchors
  beside the spotlit rect like a popover — first side with room (below → above →
  right → left), centred on the target, viewport-clamped — and FLIP-glides as the
  spotlight moves (in-flight overrides, dragged windows, layout flips). Cards can
  prefer/exclude sides (`anchorPrefer`): the landing card anchors LEFT of the
  prompt box and never 'above' (the studio logo lives there). Static placements
  remain only as fallback for no-spotlight cards (intro, finale), narrow-viewport
  misses, and during the opening sweep.


### Changed (Cat's Day Out — the run owns the spotlight)
- The "Press ▶ Go!" card now PLAYS the story properly: its Next presses the REAL
  Go button for the user (label "▶ Press Go!"), and whether Go was pressed by the
  tour or by the user's own finger, the spotlight moves to the STAGE for the whole
  run ("Playing… 🎬" while the animation lasts) and the tour advances itself when
  the story finishes — onto a card that also spotlights the stage, so the handoff
  is zero-movement. Two inert seams in the studio (`bindBlocksGo`, `onStoryRun`
  around the real flag-run lifecycle).


### Changed (tour polish — motion & dark theme)
- **Tour cards GLIDE between positions** (FLIP, 350ms) when a step or a
  Windows↔Split flip repositions them — no more teleporting; reduced-motion safe.
- **Spotlight redesigned as DE-EMPHASIS — both themes**: everything outside the
  rounded cut-out is softened behind an evenodd clip-path hole — 1px blur (text
  stays readable), theme-tuned dim, and dark = full grayscale while light keeps
  its hues at saturate 0.35 ("less colorful", not gray). The spotlight area is
  the only place with full fidelity. The ink box-shadow scrim is retired; the
  modal intro backdrop uses the same treatment (plus a light tint). Both demos
  share the effect.
- **Tour cards match the studio theme**: dark workspaces get an ink card with light
  text + hairline ring (titles explicitly colored — a global heading rule was
  leaving them ink-on-ink), still highly visible over the de-emphasized backdrop.

(theme-aware demo tour scrim)

### Fixed
- **The demo tour's spotlight scrim now reads on dark UIs.** The scrim was
  ink@50% (`shadow-spotlight-scrim`) — fine over the light studio, imperceptible
  over dark panels, so a dark-mode tour appeared to highlight nothing. The demo
  pages now pass `darkUi` from their studio's LIVE theme store
  (`usePlaygroundStore.theme` / `useBlocksTheme`) and the overlay picks the new
  `shadow-spotlight-scrim-dark` token (black@70%) — the modal backdrop follows
  the same rule (`bg-black/70` on dark). Store subscription, so a mid-tour
  theme flip re-picks the scrim immediately.

## 2026-06-12 (Guide pane dark-mode theming)

### Fixed
- **Game Guide dark mode:** the playground theme blocks now pin `color-scheme`
  (`light`/`dark` per `data-theme`), so UA-rendered chrome — native scrollbars
  on Windows / "always show" macOS, form-control internals — follows the
  workspace theme instead of staying light over the dark UI. The Guide's two
  scroll containers (nav + reader) also adopt the themed `.pg-scroll` slim bar
  (the chat-log convention); the pane's chrome/doc body/search/diagrams were
  already `pg-*`-tokened and verified readable in dark.

## 2026-06-12 (layout-proof demo tour)

### Fixed
- **The playground demo tour now works in BOTH workspace layouts** (Windows AND
  Split), including a Windows↔Split flip at ANY tour step:
  - Panel spotlights are layout-proof selector pairs
    (`[data-window="…"], [data-pane="…"]` via `panelSpotlight`): the floating
    window in Window mode, the split region in Split mode. New inert
    `data-pane` seams mark the split layout's tab region + Game pane
    (`Workspace.tsx`); `spotlightPanel` parses either form.
  - `focusPanel` (and the chat/editor handlers built on it) reads the layout at
    CALL time, so a handler the tour holds across a mid-tour flip routes through
    the layout actually on screen (split → the real Chat/Code/Assets/Guide tab,
    via the same setter the tab strip uses; `game` is a no-op there).
  - A mid-tour layout flip re-fronts the surface the visible card (or in-flight
    override) spotlights — same rule as back/forward browsing.
  - Asset generate/remix land their details AFTER My Assets is re-surfaced (the
    split layout unmounts the pane while the chat has the stage; the remount
    must re-bind the seam before the details open).
- **Pending editor jumps survive a fresh Monaco mount.** `@monaco-editor/react`
  freezes `onMount` at first render, so the "pending jump lands once the editor
  exists" fallback read a permanently-stale `jumpTo` — a changed-file tap /
  explain-select that OPENED the editor (always in Split mode, first open in
  Window mode) lost its jump+highlight/selection. Now read through a ref.

### CI
- e2e: `try-demo-smoke` gains a full 16-card SPLIT-layout tour walk with
  mid-tour Windows↔Split flips (spotlight re-resolution asserted at the error
  card); unit: `tourSpotlights.layout.test.tsx` renders the real Workspace
  shell in both layouts and asserts every panel spotlight resolves + live
  focusPanel routing through a pre-flip handler.

## 2026-06-12 (Guide pane — responsive)

### Fixed
- **The Guide reads well at ANY width.** Below 480px the two-column layout
  collapsed text into a sliver; the pane now goes single-column — the reader
  full-width, with a "☰ Topics" header chip flipping to the full-width topic
  list + search (mobile-docs pattern). Applies wherever the Guide is narrow:
  its chat-respecting spawn column, user resizes, the demo tour. Unit-tested
  (collapse threshold, toggle round-trip, wide layout untouched).
- The DEMO tour opens the Guide WIDE (560–720px via the real window-resize
  affordance, rect set pre-mount — react-rnd seeds geometry at mount only), so
  the tour showcases the two-column layout: topics and content together. Real
  users' own opens keep the chat-respecting spawn + responsive collapse.

## 2026-06-12 (Guide placement)

### Fixed
- **The Guide window never buries the conversation's latest messages.**
  (1) Spawn: TOP-LEFT of the chat — a reading column fully beside it when ≥250px
  fits (the chat launch x nudged 0.29→0.31W to make that true on common laptops),
  else a short top strip that leaves the chat's input + newest replies clear.
  (2) Layout flips: entering window mode with an open Guide overlapping the chat
  (e.g. dragged there) relocates it to the no-overlap spot, computed against where
  the chat ACTUALLY is. Placement + flip behaviour unit-tested.
- **Tour spotlights are always visible**: every card advance fronts the surface its
  spotlight points at (window mode: on top of all windows; split: its tab active) —
  universal guarantee, idempotent with the action/restart/flip refocus paths.
- **Split mode: tour cards never sit on the conversation's tail.** The chat fills
  the left region in split, so `bottom-left` cards are remapped to a new `top-left`
  placement (over the OLDEST messages) — the latest reply + input stay readable.

## 2026-06-12 (clean demo console)

### Fixed
- **No more scary DevTools noise on the public demos.** (1) Browser-extension
  noise guard, first script in every game/preview srcdoc: wallet extensions
  (Coinbase, MetaMask, …) inject providers into every frame, and inside our
  deliberately opaque-origin sandbox their `localStorage` touch throws an
  uncaught SecurityError — now cancelled before the browser logs it, and
  filtered from the kid-facing runner console. Page-world only (isolated
  content-script errors are browser-level and unreachable by any site). The
  sandbox itself is untouched — never "fix" this with `allow-same-origin`.
  (2) `/try/*` skips the app's `/auth/refresh` bootstrap — anonymous by design
  (D-DEMO-01), so the two guaranteed 401s are gone from the demo console.

## 2026-06-12

### Changed (tour pacing & navigation)
- Back/forward browsing re-fronts the window each card's spotlight points at —
  the discussed surface is always on top, not whatever the last action left focused.
  Element-level spotlights map to their HOST window (✨ toolbar → Code Editor,
  generate/remix prompts → Asset Viewer, console → Game Runner).
- Scripted replies take a readable beat (700ms → 1.8s) so the "Airo is working…"
  state is actually seen.
- Asset generation/remix now plays fully in the chat (spotlit from the click):
  the "Conjuring…" progress and the finished sticker bubble are seen scrolled
  into view, held ~1.6s, and only then does My Assets surface with the card swap.


### Fixed (spotlight timing)
- In-flight tour steps spotlight the surface where the action is HAPPENING from
  the moment Next is CLICKED, instead of jumping only when the result settled:
  chat for the scripted asks + the explain fire (before the message even sends),
  the Asset Viewer for generate and remix (while the art is being made). The
  engine raises a spotlight override at fire-time; the following card spotlights
  the same surface, so it lands with zero mask movement — killing the jank at
  the busiest moment of the turn.


### Changed (playground tour v3 — 16 cards, real Asset Viewer UI, jank pass)
- **Tour grows 13 → 16 cards** (`demoTour.playground.ts`, PRD §3 v0.9): the
  explain beat is two cards (select the snippet → the live "✨ Explain this"
  toolbar pops + is spotlighted → fire its real handler), and the beautify loop
  drives the Asset Viewer's REAL UI — the tour types the wish into the pane's
  real generate box (new card, prompt-box spotlight), submits its real
  ✨ Generate, opens the sticker's real details view with the remix wish typed
  into the real Remix bar (new card), submits the real Remix, then opens the
  landed remix's own details. New tiny default-off seams: `bindAssetPane` /
  `bindAssetRemix` (`demoMode.tsx`; registered by `AssetViewerPane`/`RemixBar`
  only under the demo provider).
- **Conversation cards spotlight the chat** ("One ask → one change",
  "Keep score", "Code that explains itself") and the after-edit auto-restart
  re-fronts the panel the next card spotlights (`restartThenRefocus` — the
  restart focuses the Game Runner, which used to bury the chat).
- **Jank pass**: heavy actions (chat sends, Monaco jumps, focus changes) defer
  behind a double-rAF so the card/spotlight transition paints first
  (`tourSequencing.ts`); the spotlight ring transitions ONLY its box geometry
  (not the giant scrim shadow) and ignores zero-size targets; cards remount per
  step with a 200ms rise/fade entrance (`animate-tour-card-in`, reduced-motion
  safe); two window focuses never land in the same frame.
- `capture-try-scenes.mjs` walk is now title-driven (`nextUntil`) so card-count
  changes don't break it; e2e smoke + umbrella harness journey updated to the
  16-card flow; new unit tests (`tourSequencing.test.ts`,
  `demoAssetPaneSeam.test.tsx`, tour-data v3 suite).

### Added (marketing-preview parity)
- `scripts/capture-try-scenes.mjs` — one-command recapture of the marketing /try
  preview scenes from the live demos (1600px JPEG q80 → `airbotix/public/media/try/`).
  AGENTS.md (root rule 3 + `src/pages/try/`) now mandates recapturing whenever the
  workspace UX changes (either studio or future demos); PRD D-DEMO-07 extended (v0.8).


### Added (tour spotlight)
- `DemoTourOverlay` steps can carry a `spotlight` selector: everything except the
  area the step points at is dimmed — one ring div whose giant box-shadow is the
  scrim, so the cut-out has properly ROUNDED corners — purely visual (nothing is
  blocked, the studio stays interactive). Every spotlight OPENS from the full
  viewport and shrinks onto its target (500ms ease-out; animates between targets
  on step change; reduced-motion safe); re-measures on resize/scroll. Wired into
  the Cat's Day Out tour: Go button, stage, "What they do" tracks, Pages rail
  (cards repositioned off their spotlights).
- Spotlight wired across the **Game Playground tour** too: every card except the
  free-explore finale highlights where to look (landing prompt box, Game Runner,
  Code Editor, Asset Viewer, console, Guide — via a new `data-window` attribute on
  the studio's floating windows + a `landing-prompt-box` testid, both inert).
  The mask now also TRACKS moving targets (light 250ms poll with change-detection)
  since playground windows are draggable.


### Fixed (zone labels refinement)
- Rail tags (Characters/Pages) no longer overflow their narrow columns — stacked
  variant (emoji above one tiny word, spanning the column like a header) with
  ellipsis as a safety net; the block-category bar gained its missing tag
  ("🧰 Kinds", full-width header above the buttons; aria updated to match).


### Added
- **Blocks Studio zone labels (clarity pass).** Every studio area now wears a small
  emoji-first name tag for pre-readers (ages 5–8): 🎬 Stage, 🐱 Characters, 📖 Pages,
  🧩 Blocks (palette), ✨ What they do (program area). Chips are decoration only
  (`pointer-events: none`, `aria-hidden`; each zone carries a matching `aria-label`),
  theme-aware via the existing `--bsx-*` tokens, tinted with the same category colour
  as each zone's wash, hidden in present mode and while a block drag is live, and
  shrink to emoji-only under 640px. The program empty-state copy now matches its label
  ("Tap a 🚩 block to pick what ⟨name⟩ does ✨"). `/try/blocks` inherits via parity.

### Changed
- `/try/blocks` always opens in the LIGHT theme (the story art is daylight-first),
  regardless of system preference or a stored studio override — store-only set on
  demo install, never written to localStorage, so a real user's saved theme is
  untouched.


### Fixed (review pass)
- Tour robustness guards from the adversarial review: the landing "Create the game" fires
  once per (long) recovery window — a slow build can no longer be double-submitted; asset
  generate/remix retries are throttled to ~2s (was every 250ms) so a failed generation
  can't spam the chat.


### Changed
- **`/try/playground` tour refinement pass (try-demo-mode-prd §3 v0.6, 8 tweaks).**
  (1) Only the tour card creates the game: the landing's own send button is disabled and
  Enter is inert while the demo locks the prompt (2-line conditional in `LandingScreen`).
  (2) The generating phase now plays the REAL first-build progress UI: a `demoBuild` branch
  in `GeneratingScreen` feeds the bundled starter's files through the same thinking →
  building (file-by-file reveal) → done pipeline a real streamed turn drives, and the new
  canned `firstTurnReply` seeds the workspace chat exactly like a real first turn (no more
  generic loading screen + starter message). (3) The acting window always comes to front:
  scripted chat asks focus the Chat window before sending (diff/explain/asset/guide/run
  already focused theirs). (4) The explain step now SHOWS the real "✨ Explain this"
  floating toolbar first: the editor jump gained an optional `select` mode
  (`openFileAt(..., select)` → Monaco `setSelection` through the REAL selection pipeline,
  so the toolbar pops over the snippet), holds the beat ~1.6s, then fires the toolbar's own
  handler. (5) "Make it beautiful" is now a 3-card loop that closes: generate the apple
  sticker → remix it golden → a new scripted edit wires the remixed asset in as the game's
  apple (+ auto-restart, so the user sees THEIR art in-game). Demo generations serve
  hand-crafted SVG art (gradient/shaded apple + golden sparkly remix + a glossy generic
  fallback, `demoAssets.playground.ts`) via a new `setDemoAssetGen` seam — the real offline
  stub's deterministic swatches are untouched. (7) The console's real "Ask AI to fix"
  button continues the script: the scripted agent recognises the console's fix-request
  prompt (`consoleFixTrigger` + `isConsoleFixPrompt`, drift-alarmed against the exported
  `fixPrompt`) and replays the fix turn + advances the tour — no contact-us dead end.
  (8) The demo Game Guide now bundles the REAL corpus (verbatim copy of
  `platform-backend/src/help/help-content.ts`, drift-alarmed in tests against the sibling
  source) and the guide step opens directly on the most diagram-rich page
  (`engine/scenes-and-the-game-loop`, 2 diagrams) via a new `openGuide` studio control.
  Tour is now 13 cards; script v3 (6 steps). e2e smoke updated (13-card walk + landing
  inert + console-button path); unit tests cover every new seam.

### Fixed
- **Game Runner console now auto-scrolls to the latest output.** The console's scroll
  container had no scroll management: it opened scrolled to the TOP, so the newest line —
  including the very error that auto-opened it — could sit out of view, and new output kept
  appending below the fold. The line list is now a `ConsoleList` component on the chat's
  `useStickToBottom` state machine: opening the panel starts pinned at the latest line, new
  lines keep the view glued while the kid is at/near the bottom, and a deliberate scroll-up
  releases the pin (no yanking). Component tests cover open-at-bottom, follow, and no-yank.

### Added
- **`/try/playground` T1 v2 full product tour** (try-demo-mode-prd §3 v0.5, 11 steps): the demo
  now starts on the REAL landing phase (prompt pre-filled + locked, chips/mic hidden; the step-1
  card sits beside the input and is not skippable; "Create the game" drives the real create flow
  via a `bindLandingSubmit` seam); workspace entry auto-opens the Game Runner and starts the game;
  every scripted change auto-restarts it through the real run path. New tour beats: code-editor
  diff jump+highlight (the real changed-file-row path), select-code → "✨ Explain this" (scripted
  plain-words answer matching the real `buildExplainPrompt`), Asset Viewer generate + remix via the
  existing offline stubs, a deliberate bug turn (undefined method → real console error) followed by
  a scripted fix turn, and an in-studio Game Guide step served by a bundled offline corpus (new
  `setDemoHelpCorpus` seam in `helpApi.ts` — zero `GET /help/docs`). Tour data lives in
  `demoTour.playground.ts` (copy/placement/action per card); the script is versioned v2 with
  `edit` + `explain` step kinds (`demoScript.playground.ts`).
- Emoji-art demo starter: the catcher's sprites are now real VFS assets (`assets/apple.svg` 🍎,
  `assets/basket.svg` 🧺) loaded by the game AND listed in the Asset Viewer, so the art on screen
  is the art in the viewer.
- New studio injection points (all optional-context reads, default off): `LandingScreen` locked
  prompt + submit bind; `Workspace` `bindStudioControls` (run/restart, panel focus, editor jump,
  explain-this, asset generate); `helpApi` demo-corpus seam. `buildExplainPrompt` moved verbatim
  from `Workspace.tsx` to `panes/explainPrompt.ts` so the demo can match the real prompt.

### Changed
- Tour overlay (`DemoTourOverlay`): step-aware card placements (`beside-input` / `bottom-left` /
  `bottom-right` / `top-right` / `center`) so a card never covers the surface its step points at;
  the Next pill truncates inside the card instead of overflowing on long labels; per-step
  `hideSkip` (used by the mandatory landing step).
- `playwright.config.ts`: `PW_PORT` env override so ad-hoc e2e runs never reuse a developer's
  running dev server on the default port 4321.
- `e2e/try-demo-smoke.spec.ts` walks the full v2 tour end-to-end (locked landing → auto-run →
  scripted asks with restarts → diff → explain → asset magic → error→fix → guide → free explore →
  AI gate) and now also forbids `/help/*` requests.
- Demo banner (`/try/*`) copy made concise: "🎈 Demo mode · Questions? Contact us →", now
  linking to the marketing site's contact page (`airbotix.ai/contact`) instead of `/book`;
  blocks tour final step aligned ("Contact us from the banner above"). The nothing-is-saved
  message stays in the tour copy.
- `/try/blocks` tour copy rewritten: concise, user-journey guidance only — dropped the
  meta/technical reassurances ("not a mock-up", "real product") from every card.
- `/try/playground` tour copy given the same treatment (no "locks the prompt", "scripted",
  "Monaco", persistence/reset talk); both tours' final card now ends with the contact-us
  pointer and (blocks) a tablet/touch encouragement. "Nothing is saved" removed from all
  guidance per product direction — the demo banner + PRD carry the persistence truth.
- Tour overlay polish: buttons never wrap mid-label (single-line pills), controls row
  wraps gracefully, all controls are ≥44px touch targets for tablets; final-step button
  shortened to "Explore freely ✨".

### Added
- Demo Home exit (`/try/blocks`): the studio's 🏠 button leaves to the marketing "Try it"
  page — mode-aware default: prod builds → `airbotix.ai/try`, dev builds → the local marketing dev server (`localhost:3000/try`); `VITE_MARKETING_URL` overrides — instead of the authed
  hub — one `demo?.exitHref` seam in the Blocks toolbar.

## 2026-06-11 (Try Demo Mode — public /try/* demos)

### Added
- **Try Demo Mode** (`try-demo-mode-prd.md`): public, no-auth demo routes that render the **real,
  unmodified studios** — `/try/playground` (Game Playground) and `/try/blocks` (Blocks Studio) —
  mounted top-level like `/play/:shareId`. New demo layer in `src/pages/try/`:
  - `DemoModeProvider`/`useDemoMode` context (null = off everywhere outside `/try/*`);
  - in-memory demo adapters (D-DEMO-02): bundled fruit-catcher starter VFS behind
    `resolveProjectFiles`, an in-memory Map behind ALL `projectPersistence` reads/writes (no
    IndexedDB), an in-memory blocks adapter behind `loadBlocksProject`/`saveBlocksProject` serving
    the bundled 3-page **"Cat's Day Out"** `BlocksProject` (validated by the real parser, played by
    the real interpreter) — zero `/projects*`/`/llm/*` calls, pristine reset on every entry/reload;
  - **scripted demo agent** (D-DEMO-04) behind the existing `gameAgentStub` `RunTurn` seam: locked
    initial prompt + 3 canned turns (fall speed → score ×10 → bigger basket + "You win!") whose
    diffs flow through the real store funnel (undo/history identical to production); any other
    prompt — and everything after the script — gets the **contact-us gate** reply (D-DEMO-06,
    airbotix.ai/book + /contact);
  - `DemoTourOverlay` (D-DEMO-05; modal intro + floating step cards, progress dots,
    Next/Back/Skip) and the `DemoBanner` "nothing is saved · Book a chat" strip (D-DEMO-08; cloud
    share is hidden in the blocks demo).
  Tiny behaviour-neutral injection points only (all default "off"): demo seams in
  `playgroundApi`/`projectPersistence`/`gameAgentStub`/`blocksApi`, optional demo context reads in
  `PlaygroundApp` (locked prompt → straight to build) and `Workspace` (tour drives the real chat
  `send`), an optional `projectId` prop + share gate in `BlocksStudioPage`, and one scoped
  `.bsx-demo-host` height rule in `blocks.css`.
- **`AGENTS.md` demo-parity mandate** (D-DEMO-07): new repo-root `AGENTS.md` + scoped
  `src/pages/try/AGENTS.md` — any studio behaviour/route/selector change must update the demo
  script/story/overlay and re-run the demo tests in the same task.
- Tests: scripted-agent sequence + gate (drift alarms on the starter/script anchors), blocks story
  round-trip through `parseProject` + real-interpreter playthrough, in-memory adapter semantics
  (no fetch, reset-on-reinstall), tour overlay flow, public-route + no-network page tests for both
  demos, and a no-mock e2e smoke (`e2e/try-demo-smoke.spec.ts`: full tour → 3 scripted turns →
  AI gate; blocks Go/run + page navigation + share hidden; zero forbidden requests).

## 2026-06-11 (Blocks Studio — stable fullscreen)

### Fixed
- **Blocks Studio no longer flickers out of fullscreen and snaps back on the next tap.** The
  immersive page-scroll lock + first-gesture `requestFullscreen` lived on the studio component, so
  any transient remount (e.g. the periodic auth refresh briefly swapping the route through
  `ProtectedRoute`) ran the unmount cleanup — exiting fullscreen — and re-armed the one-shot enter,
  which the next tap re-triggered. Moved this lifecycle into **`LearnLayout`**, which stays mounted
  across the studio's remounts and keys off the route, so a remount can't drop/re-request fullscreen.
  Once the user (or browser) leaves fullscreen, we no longer auto-yank them back in.

## 2026-06-11 (Blocks Studio — closer to ScratchJr)

### Fixed
- **The Page block (Go to Page) only lets you pick a page that exists.** Its number stepper was
  capped at the generic 1–9; it now caps at the project's page count (and the editor reads
  "Which page? (1–N)"). `setParam` gained an optional `max`.

### Added
- **Four ScratchJr blocks that were missing** (`blocksModel.ts`, `interpreter.ts`):
  - **Set Speed** (🐢/🚶/🐇) — tap to cycle slow/normal/fast; scales that character's motion (slow 2×,
    fast 0.5×).
  - **On Bump** (💥) — a hat that fires when this character collides with another (grid-cell overlap,
    once per contact).
  - **Send Message** (📤) + **Get Message** (📥) — six colours; sending fires every Get-Message script
    of the same colour across the page (ScratchJr-style broadcast). Tap to cycle the colour.
  Message/bump-triggered scripts run concurrently and are awaited before the run ends (capped for
  safety). Still missing vs ScratchJr (by request): Play Recorded Sound; and Repeat/Forever as true
  nesting C-blocks (our ♾️ Again loops the whole track — the C-block needs the nestable-block model,
  PRD M3).

## 2026-06-11 (Blocks Studio — parallel tracks fix)

### Fixed
- **Multiple 🚩 tracks on one character now run in parallel without clobbering each other.**
  The interpreter captured a sprite-state snapshot at the start of each step and re-emitted the
  whole object after animating, so a second track (e.g. a Hop) snapped the first track's changes
  (e.g. a Move) back — only the last script appeared to run. Each block now merges just its delta
  onto the **latest** committed state (`interpreter.ts`), so concurrent tracks accumulate (matching
  ScratchJr's green-flag behaviour). Hop only touches y; Go Home stays a full explicit reset.
  Tests: 2 new parallel-track cases.
- **The "currently running" glow now lights up every track at once.** The run-highlight map was keyed
  by character, so two tracks on the same character overwrote each other's active block — only one lit
  at a time, making parallel runs look sequential. It's now keyed per **script** (like ScratchJr, which
  highlights the running block in every thread). Harness: `kid-blocks-parallel`.

## 2026-06-11 (Blocks Studio — refinement pass)

### Added
- **Share / view-only play** for Blocks Studio — the SAME parent-approval flow + play-count as
  Game Studio (reuses the kind-agnostic share API: ask → grown-up approves → frozen snapshot →
  live `/play/:shareId`). New `BlocksSharePanel` (theme-aware) in the toolbar; the public play page
  renders a new **read-only `ReadOnlyBlocksPlayer`** (big stage + Play button, no editing chrome,
  no auth) detected from `project.blocks.json` in the frozen snapshot.
- **Drag a block across tracks.** With multiple 🚩 tracks, a body block can now be dragged from one
  track into another (new `blocksStore.moveBlockAcross`); the insertion bar shows in the target track.
- **Number +/− sound effects** (`sfx.numUp/numDown`) and a **mute/unmute toggle** in the toolbar
  (persisted), plus an undo/redo cue.
- **Bigger emoji library** — 8 clear, evenly-sized categories (~130 emoji): Animals, Critters, Sea,
  People, Fantasy, Vehicles, Food, Fun. Category tabs are now a fixed equal size.

### Changed
- **Tablet block drag is hold-to-lift.** A quick swipe on a block now SCROLLS the palette / program;
  a short hold lifts it to drag (then JS locks page-scroll). Fixes blocks getting stuck on tablets
  and the scroll-vs-drag conflict. Mouse still drags on a small move.
- **One generic starter.** The Create hub offers a single "New project" card; every new project opens
  on a working scene — a cat that **chases a bouncing ball** (both loop forever) — to remix.
- **Unlimited pages** (was capped at 4).
- **Page thumbnails mirror each page's scene** (animated background), not a flat blue/space swatch.
- **Reset** got a proper icon (`RotateCcw`) + a friendly confirmation card.
- The stage **background button** is a themed glass chip with a clear picture icon (flips with the theme).
- **Landscape coding band**: all six categories show in a compact 2×3 grid (no scroll) and the band is
  taller so several tracks are visible at once.

### Fixed
- **Tapping a character no longer triggers the browser's text-selection / "Search" callout** (and no
  double-tap zoom in the studio): `user-select`/`-webkit-touch-callout`/`touch-action` hardened, inputs
  re-enable text.

### Changed (toolbar + picker follow-ups)
- **Toolbar redesigned to fewer buttons.** Secondary actions (Day/Night, Reset, Big screen) collapse
  into a **⋯ More** menu so the bar no longer squashes in portrait; ▶ Go! never wraps to two lines.
- **The currently-running block now lights up** as the program executes (live `lit` glow, wired from a
  new interpreter `onStep` callback).
- **Friend-picker categories all fit** (a 4-column wrapping grid) — no horizontal scroll.
- **Mute button shows its state** with a distinct coral wash when sounds are off.

## 2026-06-10 (Magic card dark-theme fix)

### Fixed
- **Magic Generation card now follows the dark theme** (`MagicGenerationCard.tsx`). The card's
  inner panel, prompt chip, Cancel/Dismiss buttons, orb/reference rings, and progress track were
  hardcoded light (`from-white`, `bg-white`, `#fff`, `#EDE9F7`) while the text used themeable
  `pg-*` tokens — so in dark theme the bright panel stayed light and the heading (`text-pg-text`)
  flipped light and rendered invisibly on it. Replaced the hardcoded surfaces with themeable
  `pg-surface`/`pg-surface-2`/`pg-text` tokens so the whole card flips with the workspace theme.
  Added `MagicGenerationCard.test.tsx`.

### CI
- **Unblock lint (`eslint . --max-warnings 0`)** — `WorkingCard.tsx` exported the `formatSecs`
  helper alongside the component, tripping `react-refresh/only-export-components` and failing CI on
  `main` since the one-message-turn change. Moved `formatSecs` into the pure-logic `turnProgress.ts`
  (next to its sibling time helpers); `WorkingCard` + its test now import it from there.

## 2026-06-10 (Airo — named helper + avatar)

### Added
- **The playground chat helper is now "Airo"** (named from Airbotix) with a friendly robot
  **avatar** (`AiroAvatar.tsx` — self-contained SVG: brand sky→purple head, glowing antenna,
  mint eyes). Replaces the generic "AI Helper" label + plain circle in the chat header and on
  every settled message; the kid-safety disclosure now reads "I'm Airo, a robot helper — not a
  person." (Parent-facing audit copy stays "AI helper" for clarity.)

## 2026-06-10 (one-turn-one-message working card)

### Added
- **Honest in-flight `WorkingCard` for every chat turn** (`WorkingCard.tsx`, `turnProgress.ts`).
  Replaces the fake-cycling `ThinkingBubble` (which "did NOT report real server stages") with a
  card that shows REAL steps built from the agent's actual tool/action deltas — "Adding Aliens ✍️",
  "Making sure it works 🚀" — deduped by file, with a per-step timer and a total clock. A file
  re-write (a syntax-fix pass) shows as a calm "fixing" beat on its row, never an error dump.

### Changed
- **One turn now resolves to exactly ONE message.** The pending bubble is the `WorkingCard` while
  the turn works; the first summary token flips it to the single settled message (`useGameAgent`).
- **Self-verify auto-fix is no longer a second message.** A successful repair (`/code/verify-fix`)
  applies **silently** behind a transient "Fixing a little glitch 🔧" card — no extra chat bubble,
  so a kid request reads as one message + a game that now works. Only an exhausted/co-debug fix
  surfaces a single warm "let's fix this together 🔧" message. This removes the old "responded,
  but still thinking" gap (the auto-fix used to append `AUTOFIX_TEXT` + its own result bubble).
- **Settled message restyled to the feature-focused design** (`AIChatPanel.tsx`). The done message
  is now a raised card with an "AI Helper" header, dark **feature-focused change rows** (the friendly
  change leads, e.g. "The aliens shoot lasers now", with the file name riding quietly beneath + a
  chevron that opens the editor), and a "WHAT NEXT?" label above outlined chips — matching the mockup.
- **Change highlight clears on click** (`MonacoEditor.tsx`). Tapping a changed-file row still opens
  the editor and highlights the changed lines, but the highlight now disappears the moment the kid
  clicks anywhere in the code (it returns next time a change row is tapped).

## 2026-06-10 (blocked-build explanation)

### Added
- **A safety-refused first build now explains itself + offers a way forward** instead of dropping
  the kid into a silent empty project. When the opening turn is rejected by the moderation gate
  (`MODERATION_REJECTED`), `GeneratingScreen` flags `blocked` on the scaffold hand-off; `useGameAgent`
  then seeds the chat with a friendly note ("our safety helper thought the idea sounded a bit too
  rough… your project is open and ready") plus 2–3 tappable gentler game ideas (spaceship dodging
  asteroids, plane racing through rings, catch the falling treats). Tapping a chip sends that prompt
  and builds the game — the kid is never stuck. Threaded `blockedSeed` through PlaygroundApp → Workspace
  → useGameAgent.

## 2026-06-10 (guided chip loop)

### Changed
- **Tapping a next-step chip now continues the guided build loop** (playground-ai-prompt-prd.md
  D-PAP-29). A tapped chip sends its prompt as a **`guided`** step (`AIChatPanel.tsx` →
  `useGameAgent.ts` → `codeApi.ts` POST `guided:true`), so the teacher re-offers a fresh set
  of options for the next phase instead of treating the tap as a "clear instruction" that
  ended the loop after one step. Free-typed messages stay un-guided. The guided flag is
  preserved on retry.
- **A self-verify auto-fix no longer wipes the kid's still-unused next-step chips**
  (D-PAP-29 sticky). The last-message-only clear in `useGameAgent.applyResult` is skipped
  for an auto-fix turn (`keepOtherNextSteps`), so a background repair firing right after a
  build can't erase options the kid was about to tap. New unit tests in `useGameAgent.test.ts`
  + `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`.

## 2026-06-10 (playground chat resume)

### Fixed
- **Chat history is now persisted across exit/resume** (J9). The conversation lived only in
  React state, so reopening a project lost every prior turn. The chat is now cached device-local
  in IndexedDB (`projectPersistence.ts`, `chat:` prefix — same store as the VFS/workspace-UI
  cache), restored on resume (`PlaygroundApp` `onDone`), and re-seeded into the agent
  (`useGameAgent` `initialChat`, which takes precedence over the first-turn/intro seed). The rich
  per-message data (next-step chips, per-file change rows, file notes) survives — the backend's
  CodeAgentTurn only records prompt+summary, so the log is kept client-side.
- **The canned "your game starter is ready to play" message no longer reappears on resume.** On a
  resume the blank prompt fell through to `buildIntro('')`, re-injecting the starter as if the
  project were brand new. The seed now requires a non-empty prompt (and restored history wins), so
  the starter shows only as the first message of a genuinely new project.

## 2026-06-10 (playground theming fixes)

### Fixed
- **Share-link popup was nearly invisible** (`ShareLinkPanel.tsx`). The popup portals into
  `document.body` — OUTSIDE the playground's `data-theme` root — so the `--pg-*` tokens (scoped
  to `[data-theme]`) were undefined there, rendering the surface/border transparent and the text
  near-invisible. The portal now carries `data-theme={theme}` (restoring the token cascade) and
  uses the raised `bg-pg-surface` instead of the page-matching `bg-pg-desktop`, so it lifts off
  the backdrop with a visible boundary.

### Changed
- **Themed chat scrollbar.** New reusable `.pg-scroll` utility (`playground.css`) — a slim (8px),
  rounded, transparent-track scrollbar whose thumb is toned from `--pg-text-muted` and brightens on
  hover, so it matches both light/dark chrome instead of the heavy default OS bar. Applied to the
  chat log (`AIChatPanel.tsx`).

## 2026-06-10 (playground next-step chips)

### Changed
- **Playground chat: next-step chips now appear only on the latest turn.** When a new
  teacher turn settles, any next-step option chips carried by an earlier chat bubble are
  cleared, so suggestions never linger on a stale message (`useGameAgent.ts`). Pairs with
  the backend making `next_steps` conditional — the kid sees options only when they
  haven't already given a clear next step (playground-ai-prompt-prd.md D-PAP-26).

## 2026-06-09 (safety gaps)

### Added
- **Parent "see what they tried" view** (`AuditPage.tsx`). `safety.pattern.escalated` events now render a distinct coral card with an expandable category summary (icon + label + count per rejection category, time window). Fetches from the new `/families/:familyId/kids/:kidId/safety-summary` endpoint (§8 D-PF12).

### Fixed
- **`auditCopy.ts` `describeSafety()` used wrong event type names.** The function had fictitious event strings (`safety.regex.rejected`, `safety.pii.input_blocked`, `safety.topic.rejected`, `safety.injection.blocked`) that the backend never emits. Corrected to match actual backend events: `safety.prompt.rejected` (with `payload.stage` discrimination), `safety.pii.blocked`, `safety.pii.warned`. Added `safety.pii.warn_acknowledged`, `safety.prompt.aborted`, `safety.response.rejected`, `safety.response.redacted` cards. Parent audit page now shows correct friendly copy for all safety events.
- **`dismissWarn()` in `useCodeStudio.ts` and `useGameAgent.ts` never emitted `safety.prompt.aborted`** (PRD §7). Both now fire `POST /safety/prompt-aborted` (fire-and-forget) when the kid dismisses the warn dialog without retrying.
## 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Tutoring page now shows the family's classes** (`/portal/tutoring`, O-5 read-only view).
  Above the bill, one card per enrolled kid+class: class name + 私教/官方课 badge + whose class,
  the **teaching team**, **接下来的课** (upcoming scheduled sessions, up to 5), and a collapsible
  **课程大纲** (published lesson outline — titles + one-liners; unpublished packs show nothing).
  Backed by `GET /tutoring/families/:id/classes`.
- **"✨ Explain this" selection toolbar in the code editor** (`learn-game-studio-prd.md`).
  Selecting a block of code in Monaco surfaces a floating "Explain this" pill (a content
  widget anchored to the selection); clicking it hands the snippet to the AI chat, which
  answers in plain words. The prompt asks the agent not to edit; under the playground
  teacher model the turn auto-applies with no agency gate, so a plain `send` answers
  directly. The backend already has the full file as context, so only the snippet is sent
  (capped at 1200 chars). Files: `panes/MonacoEditor.tsx` (the toolbar content widget),
  `panes/CodeEditorPane.tsx` (prop pass-through), `Workspace.tsx` (prompt + chat focus).
  Tests: `e2e/playground.spec.ts` (select→explain→reply).

## 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **e2e specs rewired to the chat-hosted asset flow.** `e2e/asset-gen.spec.ts` +
  `e2e/playground.spec.ts` no longer drive the removed in-pane `asset-add-to-game` /
  `library-add-to-game` detail flow. Generate/Remix now assert the **chat** surface:
  the finished asset is a tappable `chat-asset-open` card; tapping it opens the asset in
  the viewer (`asset-codeRef`). Stars-debit + remix `ref_url` assertions kept; the Library
  test now proves the URL-form code-ref (referenced, not inlined). Dropped the stale
  add-to-game CTA screenshot test + baseline. (Matches the cross-repo `kid-playground-asset`
  harness journey, also rewired.)
- **Chat generation UX polish.** The Asset Viewer's Generate/Remix no longer shows a
  "sent to chat" banner — instead it **brings the Chat to front** (and the chat
  auto-scrolls to the new message). A **remix** now shows the **reference asset** in the
  in-flight chat card. The finished-asset chat card drops the "Add to my game" button,
  shows the asset **larger**, and is **tap-to-open** in the Asset Viewer. Also removed the
  "Add to my game" button from the Asset Viewer detail screens (confusing) — the AI wires
  assets into the game from chat; the copy-able code-ref remains for manual use.
- **AI asset generation now lives in the CHAT** (learn-game-studio-assets-prd §3) — the
  single home for all AI conversation. A typed message is classified server-side as an
  **asset** request vs a **game-code** change (`/turn/classify` returns `intent`) and
  routed: an asset request generates as a chat message (the `MagicGenerationCard` while
  it runs, then the finished asset with **Add to my game**); a code request runs the
  usual game turn. Generation and code turns **share one in-flight lock** (one AI thing
  at a time). The Asset Viewer's **Generate / Remix** buttons now post into the chat
  (`onRequestAssetGen` → `useGameAgent.requestAssetGen`) instead of rendering their own
  card — both entry points, one place out. The `generationStore` engine + magic-card
  visual are reused; the Asset Viewer's pinned card was removed.

### Fixed
- **Imported text assets preview as readable text again.** Local import (D-ASSET A4)
  stores every file as a `data:` URL, so a `.txt`'s content was a base64 data URL and the
  Asset Viewer text preview showed the encoded string. Added `dataUrlToText` (decodes
  base64/percent-encoded text data URLs, UTF-8 safe; passes raw AI/editor text through)
  and use it in `AssetPreview`.
- **Generated/imported assets now persist across exit & resume.** Two causes: (1) the
  debounced autosave was cancelled when leaving the project — added `flushSave()` in
  `PlaygroundApp` that commits any pending save on exit (and reused it for the debounce);
  (2) asset content round-trip mangled the bytes — the studio VFS uses `data:` URLs but
  the backend stores raw base64, so `codeApi` now converts binary-asset content at the
  API boundary (strip on save, re-wrap on load). SVG (backend-text) round-trips verbatim.

### Added
- **Global "Magic Generation" state (`generationStore`).** AI asset generation is now an
  app-level Zustand store that owns the async call AND the completion (writing the asset
  into the VFS), so a single in-flight generation survives the Asset Viewer pane closing/
  reopening — one generation at a time, cancellable (abort signal threaded through
  `runGen`/`api.generateAsset`). Paired with a magical animated card (`MagicGenerationCard`).
- **Asset Library expanded from ~68 to ~280 curated emoji** across faces / characters /
  animals / food / plants / weather / items / vehicles / sports / music / symbols.

### Removed
- **Playground: dropped the seeded `assets/README.txt`** from the starter project — new
  game projects start with a truly empty `assets/`.

### Added
- **Self-verify round-trip — the studio reports runtime errors so the agent auto-fixes**
  (`playground/verifyRoundtrip.ts`, `panes/GameRunnerPane.tsx`, `panes/useGameAgent.ts`, `panes/gameAgent.ts`,
  `Workspace.tsx`, `code/codeApi.ts`; `playground-ai-prompt-prd.md` MP3 / D-PAP-09,13,23). The game runs in
  the opaque-origin sandbox, so the captured console is the only runtime-error signal. `extractRuntimeErrors`
  pulls the real `error`-level lines (drops logs/warnings + the shim's "ready", formats `text (file:line)`,
  de-dupes, caps at 6); `GameRunnerPane` reports them once per distinct (run, error-set) via `onRuntimeErrors`;
  `useGameAgent.autoFixFromErrors` posts them to the backend (`reportRuntimeErrors` → `POST …/code/verify-fix`),
  applies the returned fix turn, or shows the **"let's debug this together"** message once the backend has
  exhausted its ≤2 attempts (`co_debug`). The auto-fix budget resets on each fresh kid-initiated turn. New
  `VerifyFixResult` type + `reportRuntimeErrors` injected through the `GameAgentDeps` seam. Covered by
  `verifyRoundtrip.test.ts`; the full apply→run→report→re-run round-trip is exercised by the umbrella harness.
- **Resume recap — "welcome back, here's where we left off"** (`playground/ResumeRecap.tsx`,
  `PlaygroundApp.tsx`, `Workspace.tsx`, `panes/ChatPane.tsx`, `code/codeApi.ts`; `playground-ai-prompt-prd.md`
  MP5 / D-PAP-19,22). On a genuine resume (a real game project reopened with no fresh first turn), the studio
  fetches the project's persisted `learning_context` (`getProject`) and shows a dismissible welcome-back card
  above the chat: the game summary, the concepts the kid has learned (chips), and what they were about to do
  next, with a **"Keep building →"** continue button. Best-effort + non-blocking — the kid can ignore it and
  just start typing; a fetch failure simply skips the card. `CodeProject`/`AgentTurnResult` gain
  `learning_context`. Covered by `ResumeRecap.test.tsx` (summary/concepts/next render, summary-only, continue tap).
- **Game-agent UI tool handlers — the teacher can drive the studio** (`playground/executeClientActions.ts`,
  `Workspace.tsx`, `panes/CodeEditorPane.tsx`, `panes/MonacoEditor.tsx`, `code/codeApi.ts`, `playground.css`;
  `playground-ai-prompt-prd.md` MP4 / D-PAP-08, App. A). `ClientAction` now models the full Group A–D
  surface; `executeClientActions` dispatches the **Group A teaching tools**: `open_file` /
  `jump_to_line` / `highlight_code` all route through a shared `openFile(path, fromLine?, toLine?)` so the
  studio opens the file the agent just changed and **highlights the exact line range** (Monaco whole-line
  `pg-code-highlight` decoration), plus `set_theme` / `set_layout` (wired to the playground store) and
  optional `show_console` / `physics_debug` / `set_screen_size` / `open_history` / `open_asset_viewer`
  handlers. The console's jump-to-error and the agent's open/highlight now share one location path
  (`handleOpenLocation` gains an optional `toLine`). Handlers are optional and unknown/unwired actions are
  ignored (forward-compatible), so the backend can expose the whole surface while the studio honours only
  what it can today. Covered by `executeClientActions.test.ts` (routing, mode→bool/enum mapping, invalid
  mode rejection, path-less no-op, asset-viewer fallback).

### CI
- **Fixed the playground e2e harness logging the kid out mid-test** (`e2e/helpers.ts`). The
  Workspace's ShareLinkPanel fetches `GET /projects/:id/share` on mount; unmocked, it hit the real
  backend, 401'd, and tripped `api()`'s `clearToken` → the kid bounced to `/learn/login`, unmounting
  the studio (the intermittent "element detached from the DOM" flake — machine-dependent: only bites
  where a real `:3001` backend is up). Now mocked as "not shared". Also abort the streaming first turn
  (`POST /code/turn/stream`, GeneratingScreen) so it deterministically falls back to the seeded
  `GET /code/files` instead of racing a real backend. `create-game` now passes reliably (4.3s vs prior
  timeouts). (Note: `real-ai-turn` still has a separate, pre-existing intermittent flake under
  investigation.)

### Added
- **Teacher next-step option chips in the playground chat** (`panes/AIChatPanel.tsx`,
  `panes/useGameAgent.ts`, `code/codeApi.ts`; `playground-ai-prompt-prd.md` §11.4 / D-PAP-06).
  A settled agent turn now carries the backend's `next_steps` (`{label, prompt, tag:'concept'|'fun'}`)
  onto its chat bubble and renders them as **tappable chips** — concept chips (sky/✨) and fun chips
  (bubblegum/🪄); tapping one sends its `prompt` as the next turn. `AgentTurnResult` gains
  `next_steps` + `history_label` (FE1 of the teacher model). Covered by a new `AIChatPanel.test.tsx`
  + a `useGameAgent` data-flow assertion. (History-label wiring + removing the old Lite/Pro
  agency/approval beats land in follow-ups.)

### Added
- **Private tutoring (parent portal)** (`private-tutoring-prd.md` §5, §8). New `/portal/tutoring`
  page: shows outstanding per-session charges bound to each class, totals what's owed, and starts
  an Airwallex checkout to pay all outstanding charges at once (mirrors the wallet topup flow).
  "Tutoring" nav item added.
- **Game Guide SVG concept diagrams (D-HELP-07).** New `panes/help/helpDiagrams.tsx` —
  a registry of type-safe React SVGs (xy-coordinates, game-loop, gravity-and-jump,
  collision-overlap, sprite-shapes, scene-flow) keyed by the corpus `diagram` block.
  Rendered in a captioned, theme-aware (`currentColor`) card with `role="img"` + the
  `alt` label — no HTML injection. Unknown key → alt caption fallback.
- **Playground Asset Viewer: shared read-only Library tab (zero-host emoji).** The
  pane now has a **Library | My assets** source switch (D-ASSET-6). Library browses the
  emoji provider — thumbnails load cross-origin from the CDN, category chips + search
  filter it, and a read-only detail offers **Add to my game**. "Add to game" for a
  library asset injects a **URL-form** loader (`this.load.setCORS('anonymous');
  this.load.image(key, '<cdn url>')`) via `addLibraryAssetToGame` — the asset is
  referenced by URL and never copied into the VFS, so it stays immutable + shared. The
  game preview leaves `https://` URLs un-rewritten (only VFS paths inline to data URLs),
  and the cross-origin texture is loaded `crossOrigin:'anonymous'` so the canvas isn't
  tainted (D-ASSET-7). New e2e proves browse → add → the game runs clean loading the
  emoji by URL. See PRD `learn-game-studio-assets-prd.md` A2 / §4.4.
- **Playground shared asset Library — foundation (zero-host emoji provider).** New
  `assetLibrary.ts`: a curated, kid-appropriate **emoji** catalog (characters /
  animals / food / nature / items / symbols) exposed as read-only `LibraryAsset`
  records referenced by URL — never copied into the VFS. URLs are derived from the
  emoji codepoint via `twemojiUrl()` (pinned `jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0`, VS16 stripped),
  so the asset the kid browses is exactly what the game loads (WYSIWYG). `searchLibrary()`
  filters by category + name/tags (the same shape the `search_assets` agent tool will
  use). This is the data layer for the Library source tab (Asset Viewer UI wiring lands
  next). Zero hosting (D-ASSET-11/12); hosted Kenney CC0 is the v2 provider. See PRD
  `learn-game-studio-assets-prd.md` A2 / §4.4.

### Added
- **Playground: AI remix of any image (A5, D-ASSET-5).** Image detail views (both My
  assets and the Library) now have a **Remix with AI** box: describe a change ("make it
  blue") and the AI returns a variation that lands in **My assets/generated**. Remix of
  a project asset sends `ref_asset_path`; remix of a Library asset sends its `ref_url` —
  the backend does image-to-image. The offline stub folds the reference into its hash so
  a remix is a deterministic variation. e2e proves a Library remix posts the `ref_url`
  and the result appears under My assets.

### Changed
- **Playground: `generateAsset` now sends the snake_case backend contract**
  (`project_id` / `ref_asset_path` / `ref_url`). The camelCase `GenAssetRequest` seam was
  never wired to the real DTO (asset-gen had been stub/mock only); A3/A5 make the path
  real, so the client maps the fields. Backwards-compatible for the mocked e2e.
- **Playground: hardened local asset import** (A4). Imports now fail soft (a calm
  "couldn't import that file" notice instead of a silent hang on a bad read), always
  target **My assets** (`assets/imported/`, or the open VFS category), and a drop/paste
  while browsing the read-only Library switches back to My assets so the imported file
  is actually visible.
- **Playground asset generation is now prompt-only — removed the image/audio
  dropdown** (D-ASSET-4). The kid describes what they want in one box ("a pixel
  coin", "a jump sound") and the AI decides the kind: the real backend infers it
  server-side (`/llm/generate-asset` `kind` is now optional), and the offline stub
  uses the same keyword heuristic (`inferStubKind`). The generated file's extension
  is derived from the returned mime / reported kind instead of the picker. See PRD
  `learn-game-studio-assets-prd.md` A3.

### Removed
- **Playground: dropped the seeded sample/test assets and the read-only "preloaded"
  lock.** New game projects no longer ship `coin.svg` / `hero_bounce` sprite /
  `chime.wav` / `intro.mp4` in their VFS — those were test fixtures. The Asset Viewer
  now treats every VFS asset as the kid's own (full CRUD; no `Lock` badge / "Sample —
  read-only" state). Deleted `sampleAssets.ts`, `sampleVideo.ts`, and
  `sampleAssets.test.ts`; removed `withPreloadedAssets`/`isPreloadedAsset` seeding +
  save-time filtering from `PlaygroundApp`. The shared **Library** source (Kenney CC0 +
  emoji, referenced by URL) replaces "something to start with" — see PRD
  `learn-game-studio-assets-prd.md` A0 / D-ASSET-3, D-ASSET-6. New projects start with
  an empty `assets/` (plus the `README.txt` scaffold note); Import / ✨ Generate still
  populate it. Removed the now-obsolete "samples are read-only" e2e.

### Changed
- **Game Guide pane now fetches the backend corpus (MH0 frontend-swap).** `HelpPane`
  loads `GET /help/docs` via TanStack Query and renders + searches it client-side; the
  bundled `panes/help/helpContent.ts` is **deleted** so platform-backend is the single
  source (D‑HELP‑02). New `helpTypes.ts` (shared shape) + `helpApi` becomes
  `loadHelpCorpus` + pure `searchDocs`/`getDoc`. Loading/error states added. This also
  unblocks comprehensive, clearly-tiered content (authored once, server-side). E2E mocks
  `GET /help/docs` in `mockBackendAsKid`.

### Added
- **Game Guide — `open_help` client action (MH2a, frontend)**. Extends the agent's
  `ClientAction` channel (`code/codeApi.ts`) with `open_help { target: docId, anchor? }`,
  dispatched by `executeClientActions` → a new `openHelp` handler that surfaces the Guide
  (window or Split tab) and jumps it to the passage. `HelpPane` gains a `request` prop
  (nonce-keyed, mirroring the editor's jump-to-error seam) that drives the navigation.
  This is the frontend half of HJ2: once the backend (MH2b) emits `open_help`, the kid's
  Guide opens at the cited passage. Tested: `executeClientActions.test.ts` (dispatch +
  no-target ignore + `focus_panel` to help) and `e2e/help-guide.spec.ts` HJ2 (a mocked
  turn returning `open_help` opens the Guide at the gravity passage, no VFS changes).
  The backend `search_help`/`read_help` tools + system prompt remain MH2b.
- **Game Guide — in-studio help (MH1, frontend)** for the Game Studio playground
  (PRD `docs/product/prd/learn-game-studio-help-prd.md`). A 5th playground window
  (`help`, "Guide", `BookOpen`, `brand-sunshine` accent) reachable from a desktop tile
  (Window mode) and a Split tab. Renders a curated, kid-tiered (Lite/Pro) corpus —
  Phaser 4, game basics, game-engine basics — authored as typed structured content
  (`panes/help/helpContent.ts`, no markdown/sanitizer dep) behind a `helpApi` data seam
  (client-side lexical search today; MH0 swaps it to `GET /help/docs*`). New:
  `panes/HelpPane.tsx`, `panes/help/{helpContent,helpApi}.ts`; wired through
  `playgroundStore` (`PgWindowId`), `windowMeta`, `DesktopIcon` (sunshine-contrast
  exception: solid chip + `text-ink` glyph), `Workspace`. The AI `search_help`/`read_help`
  tools + the `open_help` client action are MH2 (backend, not in this change). Tested:
  `helpContent.test.ts` (corpus invariants + the HJ6 runtime-contract/Phaser-major sync
  guard, D‑HELP‑06), `helpApi.test.ts` (search + tier filtering), `e2e/help-guide.spec.ts`
  (HJ1: open from desktop → browse → search → read → tier toggle).

### Fixed
- **Help search tokenizer strips punctuation** (`helpApi.searchHelp`) so a kid query like
  "how do I jump?" matches the "jump" tag (not "jump?"). Kept in sync with the backend
  `HelpSearchService` tokenizer (so the agent's `search_help` and the pane's own search rank
  identically).
- **e2e harness: `mockBackendAsKid` now mocks `GET /projects/*/share` → 404** ("no share
  yet"). `ShareLinkPanel` queries it on every real-project workspace; left unmocked it
  401'd → the api client cleared the kid token → a delayed bounce to `/learn/login` that
  fast specs happened to beat (and which flaked the `create-game` openCode spec). Share-
  specific specs still override with their own route (matched most-recent-first).

### Changed
- **Playground share-link control moved to the bottom bar (Taskbar), status-aware.**
  The share control used to float top-right over the desktop surface (Window mode) or
  sit in the split tab strip; it now lives on the bottom bar in **both** layout modes,
  rendered once. The button itself reflects the live share status — neutral **Share**,
  a sunshine **Waiting for grown-up** beat while a parent-approval is pending, and a
  mint **Link live** pill showing the play count once approved — and the status is
  polled even while the panel is closed, so an out-of-band parent approval (Portal)
  lights it up on its own. Clicking opens a popup rendered into `document.body` (floats
  above the desktop windows + taskbar, never clipped) anchored just above the button;
  clicking outside it or pressing Escape dismisses it. Re-enabled the previously
  `fixme`'d share-link UI e2e (now green from a direct studio load).
- **Upgraded the game runtime to Phaser 4.1.0** (from 3.80.1). Phaser 4's full build
  (`dist/phaser.min.js`) is still a UMD that sets `window.Phaser`, so the opaque-origin
  sandbox keeps loading it as a classic global `<script>` (no `allow-same-origin`, no
  CDN — the `vendor-phaser` Vite plugin re-materializes the engine + `.d.ts` into
  `public/vendor/`). Bumped `PHASER_VERSION` + the `/vendor/phaser-<v>.*` constants in
  `vite.config.ts`, `buildGamePreview.ts`, `MonacoEditor.tsx`. The `Phaser.Game`
  constructor-wrapper control channel (pause/mute/stats) still works. Verified by the
  `game-smoke` e2e (starter game runs, fps > 0, zero console errors) and the Phaser
  `.d.ts` IntelliSense e2e. The agent system prompt deliberately keeps teaching the
  Phaser-3-style game API — it's backward-compatible, runs on the Phaser 4 engine, and
  is the most reliable surface for the model to generate.
- **Playground "building your game" screen — total redesign around real progress.**
  The old screen showed a spinning orb + a fake timed progress bar + canned "Writing
  the code…" steps that didn't reflect anything real (the backend generated the whole
  game in one non-streaming call, so the first ~20–30s had no signal). `GeneratingScreen`
  now drives **three honest phases off the streamed turn**: **thinking** (turn running,
  no file yet → a fun looping platformer **build-stage** animation + rotating kid
  build-tips, since there's genuinely nothing real to show), **building** (each file
  reveals in a live list the instant the AI starts writing it — see the backend
  streaming change), and **done** (the AI's moderated reply + a short celebratory beat,
  then handoff). Stream failure still falls back to the seeded template (kid never
  trapped); resume/project-less sessions load behind the same stage. New pure-CSS
  build-stage animation in `playground.css` §5 (honors `prefers-reduced-motion`).
  Covered by `GeneratingScreen.test.tsx` (thinking → progressive file reveal → ready
  → handoff).

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` rewritten for the `airbotix-ai` umbrella era: this repo is documented as
  an umbrella submodule, product-context paths now point at the umbrella root `docs/`
  (the old `~/Documents/sites/airbotix/docs/...` paths are gone), and the
  same-commit `CHANGELOG.md` rule is stated up front. Docs only, no code change.

### Fixed
- **Playground AI chat error copy now distinguishes "couldn't reach the server" from
  "the server errored."** `useGameAgent.friendlyError` previously collapsed every
  unhandled turn failure into "Could not reach the AI" — so a real backend 5xx
  (e.g. the dev backend mid-restart) misread as a connectivity problem. Now a
  transport failure (`fetch` rejected → no `ApiError`) or a gateway-down
  502/503/504 keeps the "Could not reach the AI. Try again." copy, while any other
  reached-but-failed status shows a distinct "The AI ran into a problem. Try again
  in a moment." Covered by new `useGameAgent.test.ts` cases (transport vs 5xx vs 503).

## 2026-06-07

### Added
- Parent Portal **Courses** page (`/portal/courses`): browse published course packs and
  request a seat for a kid. Submits to `POST /bookings` (`source=parent_portal`) so the
  request lands in the super-admin Bookings inbox.
- **My Family is now a growth surface, not a settings form** (`parent-portal-growth-report-prd.md`): tapping a kid lands on a warm **growth report** (`/portal/family/:kidId`, new `KidGrowthPage`) — a one-sentence headline, highlight tiles (creations / day-streak / minutes exploring / studios tried), a 28-day daily-activity sparkline, and a friendly "what they've been making" breakdown — instead of the profile editor. The family list now shows a per-kid growth teaser (`KidGrowthTeaser`) + sparkline with a "See growth →" action, kids first and the family code demoted below. A brand-new kid shows an encouraging **🌱 early state** (reuses the onboarding `KidLoginHelper` with the copyable family code) rather than "No data". Profile / Reset PIN / Delete move verbatim to `/portal/family/:kidId/settings`. Growth derived purely from the existing usage endpoints (`/kids/:id/usage`, `/usage/trend`) in new pure helpers (`kidGrowth.ts`, +Vitest); shared `TrendBars` extracted to `src/components/`. Frontend-only, no backend change.
- Parent onboarding clarity pass (follow-up to the welcome flow): the welcome tour
  gained a concrete **"What your child will make & learn"** slide (Image/Music/Voice,
  Video, Code & Games + the skills built) and is now **re-openable any time** via a
  **"How it works"** button on the Dashboard (`openWelcomeTour`), not just on first
  login. New reusable **`StarsExplainer`** ("what are Stars?", qualitative — no hard
  $ conversion) on the top-up + wallet pages and a clearer checklist subtitle. The
  kid-login helper now shows a **QR code + "Copy login link"** (`/learn/login?family_code=…`)
  so parents don't dictate a code and kids don't type one; the kid login page pre-fills
  the family code from that query param. City is now a **dropdown of major AU cities
  (+ "Other")** on register + settings instead of free text. Adds `qrcode.react`.
- Parent-portal first-login onboarding (`parent-portal-onboarding-prd.md`): a one-time,
  skippable 3-slide **WelcomeWizard** ("what Airbotix is / you're in control / 3 next steps")
  and a persistent, data-driven **GettingStartedCard** checklist on the Dashboard (log kid in →
  add Stars → optional spending limits), plus a **KidLoginHelper** modal showing the copyable
  family code + plain-language login steps. Frontend-only: completion derived from existing
  family/wallet/payment-methods/auto-topup queries + per-parent (`sub`-keyed) localStorage flags
  (`src/lib/onboardingStorage.ts`); pure logic in `onboardingState.ts` with Vitest coverage.
  Mounted in `DashboardPage` (parent-with-family branch only). Payment step is gentle / never
  blocking (D-ONB2-02).

### Changed
- **Stars economy re-pegged: 1 star = A$0.02 (was A$1)** — mirrors platform-backend.
  Top-up packs now credit 500 / 1750 / 3250 / 7000★ (Starter/Family/Mega/School,
  incl. bonus), auto-topup SKUs + threshold options realigned to 50★ per A$, and
  Studio per-action costs updated (image 4→8★, video 5→40★; chat/voice/code/music
  unchanged) so a single chat costs ≈ A$0.02 and a $10 pack lasts hundreds of turns.
- **Activity page (`/portal/audit`) now speaks plain language.** It previously dumped
  raw machine `event_type` strings (`wallet.topup_initiated`) and the full JSON payload
  (`pack_sku`, `payment_intent_id`, `amount_aud_cents`…) — unreadable for parents. Each
  event is now mapped to a friendly icon + headline + detail line (e.g. 💳 *Top-up started
  · 10 Stars · $10.00 AUD*) via a new `src/lib/auditCopy.ts` table covering wallet / LLM /
  approval / project / auth / class / safety / family / incident events, with a title-cased
  fallback so no unmapped event ever leaks a raw `dotted.snake_case` string. The raw
  `event_type` + JSON is preserved behind a collapsed **"Technical details"** disclosure
  for auditability. Actor labels are now parent-facing ("You" / "Your child" / "AI helper").
  Vitest coverage in `auditCopy.test.ts`. Step toward the richer §4.6 vision (session
  grouping / filters / export remain unbuilt).
- `.gitignore`: explicitly ignore the compiled `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.d.ts`
  (stray `tsc -b` outputs) so they never get committed alongside `vite.config.ts`.

### CI
- `ci.yml` now actually runs the unit tests: the job runs `lint → typecheck →
  test → build` (was build-only, so the Vitest suite never ran in CI).

## 2026-06-06

### Added
- Portal onboarding captures the parent name + an editable display name.
- Playground v2 desktop workspace: window / split layout, Monaco code editor,
  Phaser game runner, standalone chat pane, taskbar + desktop icons, error
  debugging (jump-to-error + Ask AI to fix), light/dark theme, and S3-backed
  editor files.

### Fixed
- Playground UX polish: Monaco hover/suggest tooltips no longer clipped, robust
  Phaser vendoring at build time, wider editor launch, chat keeps focus/history,
  smoother generating screen.
