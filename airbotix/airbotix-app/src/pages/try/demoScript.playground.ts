// The VERSIONED scripted-demo data file for `/try/playground` (try-demo-mode-prd
// §2 D-DEMO-04 / §3 v2). Each step is either:
//   - an `edit` step: a canned kid prompt + a canned VFS diff (find/replace pairs,
//     applied through the real `useProjectStore` mutation funnel by the scripted
//     agent), or
//   - an `explain` step: the exact code snippet the tour selects in the editor —
//     the scripted agent answers the REAL "✨ Explain this" prompt
//     (`buildExplainPrompt(snippet)`) with a canned plain-words explanation.
// Steps apply strictly in order, so each edit's `find` strings target the file
// state AFTER the previous step — `scriptedAgent.test.ts` asserts every anchor
// still applies. Step 3 wires the tour-remixed sticker into the game (§3 step 7
// beautify loop); step 4 lands a DELIBERATE bug (a call to an undefined method,
// thrown the moment the scene builds, so the runner console reliably shows a
// real error); step 5 is the fix turn that repairs it (§3 steps 8–9) — it also
// fires from the console's real "Ask AI to fix" button (`consoleFixTrigger`).
//
// ⚠️ Demo parity (D-DEMO-07): if the starter files or the real studio chat flow
// change, update this script (and bump `version`) in the same task.
