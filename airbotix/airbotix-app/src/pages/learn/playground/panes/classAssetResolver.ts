// Resolve class shared assets a game REFERENCES into inline-ready virtual VFS
// files (class-shared-assets-prd, Model A). A class asset is NEVER copied into the
// kid's project VFS — the game refers to it at `assets/class/<name>` and the runtime
// resolves the bytes from the shared class library at build time (a `data:` URL
// inlined into the sandbox srcdoc, exactly like a real VFS asset). The only place a
// class asset becomes a persisted copy is the frozen public SHARE snapshot, which
// the backend bakes at share-mint.
//
// We resolve only the class assets the code actually references (not the whole
// library), and cache each by name so a referenced asset is fetched once. The
// signed `download_url` is fetched to a `data:` URL and inlined — the signed URL
// itself never enters the sandboxed game (playground CLAUDE.md security model holds).

// contain spaces (e.g. "Animated Platformer Character.glb") — a naïve `\S+`/`\s`-stopping
// class truncates at the first space and the asset never resolves → the game fetches the
// bare path against the opaque-origin frame → "Failed to fetch". Class assets are flat (a
// name, no nested dirs), so the captured name matches a class asset by `asset.name`.
